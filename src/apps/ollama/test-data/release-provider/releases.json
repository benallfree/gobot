Download it [here](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/releases/download/v0.1.25/OllamaSetup.exe). Ollama on Windows makes it possible to pull, run and create large language models in a new native Windows experience. It includes built-in GPU acceleration, access to the full [model library](https://ollama.com/library), and the Ollama API including [OpenAI compatibility](https://ollama.com/blog/openai-compatibility).\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Ollama on Windows is now available in preview.\r\n* Fixed an issue where requests would hang after being repeated several times\r\n* Ollama will now correctly error when provided an unsupported image format\r\n* Fixed issue where `ollama serve` wouldn't immediately quit when receiving a termination signal\r\n* Fixed issues with prompt templating for the `/api/chat` endpoint, such as where Ollama would omit the second system prompt in a series of messages\r\n* Fixed issue where providing an empty list of messages would return a non-empty response instead of loading the model\r\n* Setting a negative `keep_alive` value (e.g. `-1`) will now correctly keep the model loaded indefinitely\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @lebrunel made their first contribution in https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/2477\r\n* @bnorick made their first contribution in https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/2480\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ollama/ollama/compare/v0.1.24...v0.1.25",

    "body": "## New models\r\n* [Qwen](https://ollama.ai/library/qwen): Qwen is a series of large language models by Alibaba Cloud spanning from 1.8B to 72B parameters.\r\n* [DuckDB-NSQL](https://ollama.ai/library/duckdb-nsql): A text-to-sql LLM for DuckDB\r\n* [Stable Code](https://ollama.ai/library/stable-code): A new code completion model on par with Code Llama 7B and similar models.\r\n* [Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral](https://ollama.ai/library/nous-hermes2-mixtral): The Nous Hermes 2 model from Nous Research, now trained over Mixtral.\r\n\r\n## Saving and loading models and messages\r\n\r\nModels can now be saved and loaded with `/save <model>` and `/load <model>` when using `ollama run`. This will save or load conversations and any model changes with `/set parameter`, `/set system` and more as a new model with the provided name.\r\n\r\n## `MESSAGE` modelfile command\r\n\r\nMessages can now be specified in a `Modelfile` ahead of time using the `MESSAGE` command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# example Modelfile\r\nFROM llama2\r\nSYSTEM You are a friendly assistant that only answers with 'yes' or 'no'\r\nMESSAGE user Is Toronto in Canada?\r\nMESSAGE assistant yes\r\nMESSAGE user Is Sacramento in Canada?\r\nMESSAGE assistant no\r\nMESSAGE user Is Ontario in Canada?\r\nMESSAGE assistant yes\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter creating this model, running it will restore the message history. This is useful for techniques such as [Chain-Of-Thought](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot) prompting\r\n\r\n```\r\nollama create -f Modelfile yesno\r\nollama run yesno\r\n>>> Is Toronto in Canada?\r\nyes\r\n\r\n>>> Is Sacramento in Canada?\r\nno\r\n\r\n>>> Is Ontario in Canada?\r\nyes\r\n\r\n>>> Is Havana in Canada?\r\nno\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Python and Javascript libraries\r\n\r\nThe first versions of the [Python](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-js) libraries for Ollama are [now available](https://ollama.ai/blog/python-javascript-libraries).\r\n\r\n## Intel & AMD CPU improvements\r\n\r\nOllama now supports CPUs without AVX. This means Ollama will now run on older CPUs and in environments (such as virtual machines, Rosetta, GitHub actions) that don't provide support for AVX instructions. For newer CPUs that support AVX2, Ollama will receive a small performance boost, running models about 10% faster.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Support for a much broader set of CPUs, including CPUs without AVX instruction set support\r\n* If a GPU detection error is hit when attempting to run a model, Ollama will fallback to CPU\r\n* Fixed issue where generating responses with the same prompt would hang after around 20 requests\r\n* New `MESSAGE` Modelfile command to set the conversation history when building a model\r\n* Ollama will now use AVX2 for faster performance if available\r\n* Improved detection of Nvidia GPUs, especially in WSL\r\n* Fixed issue where models with LoRA layers may not load\r\n* Fixed incorrect error that would occur when retrying network connections in `ollama pull` and `ollama push`\r\n* Fixed issue where `/show parameter` would round decimal numbers\r\n* Fixed issue where upon hitting the context window limit, requests would hang\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @fpreiss made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/1921\r\n* @eavanvalkenburg made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/1931\r\n* @0atman made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/1924\r\n* @sachinsachdeva made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/2021\r\n* @Arrendy made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/2016\r\n* @purificant made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/1958\r\n* @lainedfles made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/1999\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/compare/v0.1.20...v0.1.21",

If using custom `ggml` format models in a `Modelfile`, please [import GGUF](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/import.md) models instead.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @pgibler made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/1595\r\n* @rxlabz made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/1564\r\n* @K0IN made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/1642\r\n* @Icelain made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/1708\r\n* @kghandour made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/1747\r\n* @shuhblam made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/1766\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/compare/v0.1.17...v0.1.18",

    "body": "## Phi-2\r\n\r\nThis release adds support for the [Phi-2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/phi-2-the-surprising-power-of-small-language-models/) model by Microsoft.\r\n\r\n```\r\nollama run phi\r\n```\r\n\r\nPhi-2 is a new, powerful 2.7B model with strong reasoning and language understanding capabilities comparable to larger, 13B models. Given its small size, it will run effectively on a wide set of hardware configurations.\r\n\r\n### Example prompt\r\n\r\nBy default, `phi` includes a prompt template designed for multi-turn conversations:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% ollama run phi\r\n>>> Hello, can you help me find my way to Toronto?\r\n Certainly! What is the exact location in Toronto that you are looking for?\r\n\r\n>>> Yonge & Bloor\r\n Sure, Yonge and Bloor is a busy intersection in downtown Toronto. Would you like to take public transportation or drive there?\r\n\r\n>>> Public transportation\r\n Great! The easiest way to get there is by taking the TTC subway. You can take Line 1, which runs along Yonge Street and passes through downtown Toronto.\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing Ollama's API:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d '{\r\n  \"model\": \"phi\",\r\n  \"messages\": [\r\n    { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"why is the sky blue?\" }\r\n  ]\r\n}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example prompts (raw mode)\r\n\r\nPhi also responds well to a wide variety of prompt formats when using [raw mode](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md#request-raw-mode) in Ollama's API, which bypasses all default prompt templating:\r\n\r\n#### Instruct\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{\r\n  \"model\": \"phi\",\r\n  \"prompt\": \"Instruct: Write a detailed analogy between mathematics and a lighthouse.\\nOutput:\",\r\n  \"options\": {\r\n    \"stop\": [\"Instruct:\", \"Output:\"]\r\n  },\r\n  \"raw\": true,\r\n  \"stream\": false\r\n}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Code Completion\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{\r\n  \"model\": \"phi\",\r\n  \"prompt\": \"def print_prime(n):\\n  \",\r\n  \"raw\": true,\r\n  \"stream\": false\r\n}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Text completion\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{\r\n  \"model\": \"phi\",\r\n  \"prompt\": \"There once was a mouse named\",\r\n  \"raw\": true,\r\n  \"stream\": false\r\n}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## New Models\r\n- [Phi-2](https://ollama.ai/library/phi): A versatile 2.7B model by Microsoft with outstanding reasoning and language understanding capabilities.\r\n- [Solar](https://ollama.ai/library/solar): A compact, yet powerful 10.7B large language model designed for single-turn conversation.\r\n- [OpenChat](https://ollama.ai/library/openchat): Updated to OpenChat-3.5-1210, this new version of the 7B model model excels at coding tasks and scores very high on many open-source LLM benchmarks.\r\n- [Wizard Math](https://ollama.ai/library/wizard-math): Updated to WizardMath v1.1, this 7B model excels at Math logic and reasoning and is now based on Mistral\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Fixed issues where `message` objects in `/api/chat` would return `\"images\": null` in the response\r\n* `/api/chat` now always returns a `message` object, even if `content` is an empty string\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @ianpurton made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/1463\r\n* @AugustDev made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/1529\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/compare/v0.1.16...v0.1.17",

It’s trained on a distilled dataset, improving grammar and yielding even better chat results.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Pasting multi-line strings in `ollama run` is now possible\r\n* Fixed various issues when writing prompts in `ollama run`\r\n* The library models have been refreshed and revamped including `llama2`, `codellama`, and more:\r\n  * All `chat` or `instruct` models now support setting the `system` parameter, or `SYSTEM` command in the `Modelfile`\r\n  * Parameters (`num_ctx`, etc) have been updated for library models\r\n  * Slight performance improvements for all models\r\n* Model storage can now be configured with `OLLAMA_MODELS`. See the [FAQ](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-can-i-change-where-ollama-stores-models) for more info on how to configure this.\r\n* `OLLAMA_HOST` will now default to port `443` when `https://` is specified, and port `80` when `http://` is specified\r\n* Fixed trailing slashes causing an error when using `OLLAMA_HOST`\r\n* Fixed issue where `ollama pull` would retry multiple times when out of space\r\n* Fixed various `out of memory` issues when using Nvidia GPUs\r\n* Fixed performance issue previously introduced on AMD CPUs\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @ajayk made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/855\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/compare/v0.1.5...v0.1.6",

    "body": "## New models\r\n\r\n* [OpenHermes 2 Mistral](https://ollama.ai/library/openhermes2-mistral): a new fine-tuned model based on Mistral, trained on open datasets totalling over 900,000 instructions. This model has strong multi-turn chat skills, surpassing previous Hermes 13B models and even matching 70B models on some benchmarks.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Faster model switching: models will now stay loaded between requests when using different parameters (e.g. `temperature`) or system prompts\r\n* `starcoder`, `sqlcoder` and `falcon` models now have unicode support. Note: they will need to be re-pulled (e.g. `ollama pull starcoder`)\r\n* New documentation guide on [importing existing models](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/import.md) to Ollama (GGUF, PyTorch, etc)\r\n* `ollama serve` will now print the current version of Ollama on start\r\n* `ollama run` will now show more descriptive errors when encountering runtime issues (such as insufficient memory)\r\n* Fixed an issue where Ollama on Linux would use CPU instead of using both the CPU and GPU for GPUs with less memory\r\n* Fixed architecture check in Linux install script\r\n* Fixed issue where leading whitespaces would be returned in responses\r\n* Fixed issue where `ollama show` would show an empty `SYSTEM` prompt (instead of omitting it)\r\n* Fixed issue with the `/api/tags` endpoint would return `null` instead of `[]` if no models were found\r\n* Fixed an issue where `ollama show` wouldn't work when connecting remotely by using `OLLAMA_HOST`\r\n* Fixed issue where GPU/Metal would be used on macOS even with `num_gpu` set to `0`\r\n* Fixed issue where certain characters would be escaped in responses\r\n* Fixed `ollama serve` logs to report the proper amount of GPU memory (VRAM) being used\r\n\r\nNote: the `EMBED` keyword in `Modelfile` is being revisited until a future version of Ollama. Join [the discussion](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/issues/834) on how we can make it better.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @vieux made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/810\r\n* @s-kostyaev made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/801\r\n* @ggozad made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/794\r\n* @awaescher made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/811\r\n* @deichbewohner made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/799\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/compare/v0.1.3...v0.1.4",

Set the `stream` parameter to `false` and endpoints will return data in one single response:\r\n  ```\r\n  curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{\r\n    \"model\": \"llama2\",\r\n    \"prompt\": \"Why is the sky blue?\",\r\n    \"stream\": false\r\n  }'\r\n  ```\r\n* Ollama can now be used with http proxies (using `HTTP_PROXY=http://<proxy>`) and https proxies (using `HTTPS_PROXY=https://<proxy>`)\r\n* Fixed `token too long` error when generating a response\r\n* `q8_0`, `q5_0`, `q5_1`, and `f32` models will now use GPU on Linux\r\n* Revise help text in `ollama run` to be easier to read\r\n* Rename runner subprocess to `ollama-runner`\r\n* `ollama create` will now show feedback when reading model metadata\r\n* Fix `not found error` showing when running `ollama pull`\r\n* Improved video memory allocation on Linux to fix errors when using Nvidia GPUs\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @xyproto made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/705\r\n* @konsalex made their first contribution in https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/pull/741\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/compare/v0.1.1...v0.1.2",

Compatibility & performance improvements to come\r\n* When running `ollama run`, the `/show` command can be used to inspect the current model\r\n* `ollama run` can now take in multi-line strings:\r\n  ```\r\n  % ollama run llama2\r\n  >>> \"\"\"       \r\n    Is this a\r\n    multi-line\r\n    string?\r\n  \"\"\"\r\n  Thank you for asking! Yes, the input you provided is a multi-line string. It contains multiple lines of text separated by line breaks.\r\n  ```\r\n* More seamless updates: Ollama will now show a subtle hint that an update is ready in the tray menu, instead of a dialog window\r\n* `ollama run --verbose` will now show load duration times\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Fixed crashes on Macs with 8GB of shared memory\r\n* Fixed issues in scanning multi-line strings in a `Modelfile`\r\n",
