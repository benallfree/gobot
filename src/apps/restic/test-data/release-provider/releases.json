    "body": "This release works around and improves detection of a bug in the compression library used by restic. The resulting issue only happens when using restic 0.16.3 and the `max` compression level (the default `auto` and `off` compression levels are not affected), and when the source files being backed up have specific data in them to trigger the bug. If you use `max` compression, you can use `restic check --read-data` to make sure you're not affected.\r\n\r\nrestic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you already have restic >= 0.9.4, you can use `restic self-update` to get the latest version in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that in the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/developer_information.rst).\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.16.4 (2024-02-04)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.16.4 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#4677](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4677): Downgrade zstd library to fix rare data corruption at max. compression\r\n * Enh [#4529](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4529): Add extra verification of data integrity before upload\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4677: Downgrade zstd library to fix rare data corruption at max. compression\r\n\r\n   In restic 0.16.3, backups where the compression level was set to `max` (using `--compression max`) could in rare and very specific circumstances result in data corruption due to a bug in the library used for compressing data. Restic 0.16.1 and 0.16.2 were not affected.\r\n\r\n   Restic now uses the previous version of the library used to compress data, the same version used by restic 0.16.2. Please note that the `auto` compression level (which restic uses by default) was never affected, and even if you used `max` compression, chances of being affected by this issue are small.\r\n\r\n   To check a repository for any corruption, run `restic check --read-data`. This will download and verify the whole repository and can be used at any time to completely verify the integrity of a repository. If the `check` command detects anomalies, follow the suggested steps.\r\n\r\n    [#4677](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4677) [#4679](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4679)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #4529: Add extra verification of data integrity before upload\r\n\r\n   Hardware issues, or a bug in restic or its dependencies, could previously cause corruption in the files restic created and stored in the repository. Detecting such corruption previously required explicitly running the `check --read-data` or `check --read-data-subset` commands.\r\n\r\n   To further ensure data integrity, even in the case of hardware issues or software bugs, restic now performs additional verification of the files about to be uploaded to the repository.\r\n\r\n   These extra checks will increase CPU usage during backups. They can therefore, if absolutely necessary, be disabled using the `--no-extra-verify` global option. Please note that this should be combined with more active checking using the previously mentioned check commands.\r\n\r\n    [#4529](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4529) [#4681](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4681)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "This release fixes a couple of bugs on Windows and in the `restore` command. It also works around an unlikely yet possible situation with `rclone` which could potentially result in data loss.\r\n\r\nrestic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you already have restic >= 0.9.4, you can use `restic self-update` to get the latest version in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that in the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/developer_information.rst).\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.16.3 (2024-01-14)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.16.3 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#4560](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4560): Improve errors for irregular files on Windows\r\n * Fix [#4574](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4574): Support backup of deduplicated files on Windows again\r\n * Fix [#4612](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4612): Improve error handling for `rclone` backend\r\n * Fix [#4624](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4624): Correct `restore` progress information if an error occurs\r\n * Fix [#4626](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4626): Improve reliability of restoring large files\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4560: Improve errors for irregular files on Windows\r\n\r\n   Since Go 1.21, most filesystem reparse points on Windows are considered to be irregular files. This caused restic to show an `error: invalid node type \"\"` error message for those files.\r\n\r\n   This error message has now been improved and includes the relevant file path: `error: nodeFromFileInfo path/to/file: unsupported file type \"irregular\"`. As irregular files are not required to behave like regular files, it is not possible to provide a generic way to back up those files.\r\n\r\n    [#4560](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4560) [#4620](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4620) https://forum.restic.net/t/windows-backup-error-invalid-node-type/6875\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4574: Support backup of deduplicated files on Windows again\r\n\r\n   With the official release builds of restic 0.16.1 and 0.16.2, it was not possible to back up files that were deduplicated by the corresponding Windows Server feature. This also applied to restic versions built using Go 1.21.0-1.21.4.\r\n\r\n   The Go version used to build restic has now been updated to fix this.\r\n\r\n    [#4574](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4574) [#4621](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4621) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4612: Improve error handling for `rclone` backend\r\n\r\n   Since restic 0.16.0, if rclone encountered an error while listing files, this could in rare circumstances cause restic to assume that there are no files. Although unlikely, this situation could result in data loss if it were to happen right when the `prune` command is listing existing snapshots.\r\n\r\n   Error handling has now been improved to detect and work around this case.\r\n\r\n    [#4612](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4612) [#4618](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4618) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4624: Correct `restore` progress information if an error occurs\r\n\r\n   If an error occurred while restoring a snapshot, this could cause the `restore` progress bar to show incorrect information. In addition, if a data file could not be loaded completely, then errors would also be reported for some already restored files.\r\n\r\n   Error reporting of the `restore` command has now been made more accurate.\r\n\r\n    [#4624](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4624) https://forum.restic.net/t/errors-restoring-with-restic-on-windows-server-s3/6943\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4626: Improve reliability of restoring large files\r\n\r\n   In some cases restic failed to restore large files that frequently contain the same file chunk. In combination with certain backends, this could result in network connection timeouts that caused incomplete restores.\r\n\r\n   Restic now includes special handling for such file chunks to ensure reliable restores.\r\n\r\n    [#4626](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4626) https://forum.restic.net/t/errors-restoring-with-restic-on-windows-server-s3/6943\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "restic 0.16.2 restores support for ARMv5 which was accidentally not included in the previous one, and also fixes missing documentation on [Read the Docs](https://restic.readthedocs.io/).\r\n\r\nrestic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you already have restic >= 0.9.4, you can use `restic self-update` to get the latest version in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that in the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/developer_information.rst).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.16.2 (2023-10-29)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.16.2 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#4540](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4540): Restore ARMv5 support for ARM binaries\r\n * Fix [#4545](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4545): Repair documentation build on Read the Docs\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4540: Restore ARMv5 support for ARM binaries\r\n\r\n   The official release binaries for restic 0.16.1 were accidentally built to require ARMv7. The build process is now updated to restore support for ARMv5.\r\n\r\n   Please note that restic 0.17.0 will drop support for ARMv5 and require at least ARMv6.\r\n\r\n    [#4540](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4540) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4545: Repair documentation build on Read the Docs\r\n\r\n   For restic 0.16.1, no documentation was available at https://restic.readthedocs.io/ .\r\n\r\n   The documentation build process is now updated to work again.\r\n\r\n    [#4545](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4545) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "restic 0.16.1 has been released! It contains a few usage and cosmetic improvements, but also one bugfix for a very unlikely but still possible data corruption issue when using the max compression level. Please read the changelog for more details and information on how to verify your repository if you used max compression. Please also note that the auto compression level (which is the default) was never affected.\r\n\r\nrestic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you already have restic >= 0.9.4, you can use `restic self-update` to get the latest version in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that in the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/developer_information.rst).\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.16.1 (2023-10-24)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.16.1 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#4513](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4513): Make `key list` command honor `--no-lock`\r\n * Fix [#4516](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4516): Do not try to load password on command line autocomplete\r\n * Fix [#4523](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4523): Update zstd library to fix possible data corruption at max. compression\r\n * Chg [#4532](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4532): Update dependencies and require Go 1.19 or newer\r\n * Enh [#229](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/229): Show progress bar while loading the index\r\n * Enh [#4128](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4128): Automatically set `GOMAXPROCS` in resource-constrained containers\r\n * Enh [#4480](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4480): Allow setting REST password and username via environment variables\r\n * Enh [#4511](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4511): Include inode numbers in JSON output for `find` and `ls` commands\r\n * Enh [#4519](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4519): Add config option to set SFTP command arguments\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4513: Make `key list` command honor `--no-lock`\r\n\r\n   The `key list` command now supports the `--no-lock` options. This allows determining which keys a repo can be accessed by without the need for having write access (e.g., read-only sftp access, filesystem snapshot).\r\n\r\n    [#4513](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4513) [#4514](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4514) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4516: Do not try to load password on command line autocomplete\r\n\r\n   The command line autocompletion previously tried to load the repository password. This could cause the autocompletion not to work. Now, this step gets skipped.\r\n\r\n    [#4516](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4516) [#4526](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4526) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4523: Update zstd library to fix possible data corruption at max. compression\r\n\r\n   In restic 0.16.0, backups where the compression level was set to `max` (using `--compression max`) could in rare and very specific circumstances result in data corruption due to a bug in the library used for compressing data.\r\n\r\n   Restic now uses the latest version of the library used to compress data, which includes a fix for this issue. Please note that the `auto` compression level (which restic uses by default) was never affected, and even if you used `max` compression, chances of being affected by this issue were very small.\r\n\r\n   To check a repository for any corruption, run `restic check --read-data`. This will download and verify the whole repository and can be used at any time to completely verify the integrity of a repository. If the `check` command detects anomalies, follow the suggested steps.\r\n\r\n   To simplify any needed repository repair and minimize data loss, there is also a new and experimental `repair packs` command that salvages all valid data from the affected pack files (see `restic help repair packs` for more information).\r\n\r\n    [#4523](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4523) [#4530](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4530) \r\n\r\n * Change #4532: Update dependencies and require Go 1.19 or newer\r\n\r\n   We have updated all dependencies. Since some libraries require newer Go standard library features, support for Go 1.18 has been dropped, which means that restic now requires at least Go 1.19 to build.\r\n\r\n    [#4532](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4532) [#4533](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4533) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #229: Show progress bar while loading the index\r\n\r\n   Restic did not provide any feedback while loading index files. Now, there is a progress bar that shows the index loading progress.\r\n\r\n    [#229](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/229) [#4419](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4419) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #4128: Automatically set `GOMAXPROCS` in resource-constrained containers\r\n\r\n   When running restic in a Linux container with CPU-usage limits, restic now automatically adjusts `GOMAXPROCS`. This helps to reduce the memory consumption on hosts with many CPU cores.\r\n\r\n    [#4128](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4128) [#4485](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4485) [#4531](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4531) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #4480: Allow setting REST password and username via environment variables\r\n\r\n   Previously, it was only possible to specify the REST-server username and password in the repository URL, or by using the `--repository-file` option. This meant it was not possible to use authentication in contexts where the repository URL is stored in publicly accessible way.\r\n\r\n   Restic now allows setting the username and password using the `RESTIC_REST_USERNAME` and `RESTIC_REST_PASSWORD` variables.\r\n\r\n    [#4480](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4480) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #4511: Include inode numbers in JSON output for `find` and `ls` commands\r\n\r\n   Restic used to omit the inode numbers in the JSON messages emitted for nodes by the `ls` command as well as for matches by the `find` command. It now includes those values whenever they are available.\r\n\r\n    [#4511](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4511) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #4519: Add config option to set SFTP command arguments\r\n\r\n   When using the `sftp` backend, scenarios where a custom identity file was needed for the SSH connection, required the full command to be specified: `-o sftp.command='ssh user@host:port -i /ssh/my_private_key -s sftp'`\r\n\r\n   Now, the `-o sftp.args=...` option can be passed to restic to specify custom arguments for the SSH command executed by the SFTP backend. This simplifies the above example to `-o sftp.args='-i /ssh/my_private_key'`.\r\n\r\n    [#4241](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4241) [#4519](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4519) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "restic 0.16.0 has been released!\r\n\r\nrestic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you already have restic >= 0.9.4, you can use `restic self-update` to get the latest version in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that in the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/developer_information.rst).\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.16.0 (2023-07-31)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.16.0 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#2565](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2565): Support \"unlimited\" in `forget --keep-*` options\r\n * Fix [#3311](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3311): Support non-UTF8 paths as symlink target\r\n * Fix [#4199](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4199): Avoid lock refresh issues on slow network connections\r\n * Fix [#4274](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4274): Improve lock refresh handling after standby\r\n * Fix [#4319](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4319): Correctly clean up status bar output of the `backup` command\r\n * Fix [#4333](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4333): `generate` and `init` no longer silently ignore unexpected arguments\r\n * Fix [#4400](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4400): Ignore missing folders in `rest` backend\r\n * Chg [#4176](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4176): Fix JSON message type of `scan_finished` for the `backup` command\r\n * Chg [#4201](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4201): Require Go 1.20 for Solaris builds\r\n * Enh [#426](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/426): Show progress bar during restore\r\n * Enh [#719](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/719): Add `--retry-lock` option\r\n * Enh [#1495](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1495): Sort snapshots by timestamp in `restic find`\r\n * Enh [#1759](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1759): Add `repair index` and `repair snapshots` commands\r\n * Enh [#1926](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1926): Allow certificate paths to be passed through environment variables\r\n * Enh [#2359](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2359): Provide multi-platform Docker images\r\n * Enh [#2468](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2468): Add support for non-global Azure clouds\r\n * Enh [#2679](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2679): Reduce file fragmentation for local backend\r\n * Enh [#3328](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3328): Reduce memory usage by up to 25%\r\n * Enh [#3397](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3397): Improve accuracy of ETA displayed during backup\r\n * Enh [#3624](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3624): Keep oldest snapshot when there are not enough snapshots\r\n * Enh [#3698](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3698): Add support for Managed / Workload Identity to `azure` backend\r\n * Enh [#3871](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3871): Support `<snapshot>:<subfolder>` syntax to select subfolders\r\n * Enh [#3941](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3941): Support `--group-by` for backup parent selection\r\n * Enh [#4130](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4130): Cancel current command if cache becomes unusable\r\n * Enh [#4159](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4159): Add `--human-readable` option to `ls` and `find` commands\r\n * Enh [#4188](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4188): Include restic version in snapshot metadata\r\n * Enh [#4220](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4220): Add `jq` binary to Docker image\r\n * Enh [#4226](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4226): Allow specifying region of new buckets in the `gs` backend\r\n * Enh [#4375](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4375): Add support for extended attributes on symlinks\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2565: Support \"unlimited\" in `forget --keep-*` options\r\n\r\n   Restic would previously forget snapshots that should have been kept when a negative value was passed to the `--keep-*` options. Negative values are now forbidden. To keep all snapshots, the special value `unlimited` is now supported. For example, `--keep-monthly unlimited` will keep all monthly snapshots.\r\n\r\n    [#2565](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2565) [#4234](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4234) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3311: Support non-UTF8 paths as symlink target\r\n\r\n   Earlier restic versions did not correctly `backup` and `restore` symlinks that contain a non-UTF8 target. Note that this only affected systems that still use a non-Unicode encoding for filesystem paths.\r\n\r\n   The repository format is now extended to add support for such symlinks. Please note that snapshots must have been created with at least restic version 0.16.0 for `restore` to correctly handle non-UTF8 symlink targets when restoring them.\r\n\r\n    [#3311](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3311) [#3802](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3802) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4199: Avoid lock refresh issues on slow network connections\r\n\r\n   On network connections with a low upload speed, backups and other operations could fail with the error message `Fatal: failed to refresh lock in time`.\r\n\r\n   This has now been fixed by reworking the lock refresh handling.\r\n\r\n    [#4199](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4199) [#4304](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4304) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4274: Improve lock refresh handling after standby\r\n\r\n   If the restic process was stopped or the host running restic entered standby during a long running operation such as a backup, this previously resulted in the operation failing with `Fatal: failed to refresh lock in time`.\r\n\r\n   This has now been fixed such that restic first checks whether it is safe to continue the current operation and only throws an error if not.\r\n\r\n    [#4274](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4274) [#4374](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4374) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4319: Correctly clean up status bar output of the `backup` command\r\n\r\n   Due to a regression in restic 0.15.2, the status bar of the `backup` command could leave some output behind. This happened if filenames were printed that are wider than the current terminal width. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#4319](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4319) [#4318](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4318) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4333: `generate` and `init` no longer silently ignore unexpected arguments\r\n\r\n    [#4333](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4333) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4400: Ignore missing folders in `rest` backend\r\n\r\n   If a repository accessed via the REST backend was missing folders, then restic would fail with an error while trying to list the data in the repository. This has been now fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#235](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/235) [#4400](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4400) \r\n\r\n * Change #4176: Fix JSON message type of `scan_finished` for the `backup` command\r\n\r\n   Restic incorrectly set the `message_type` of the `scan_finished` message to `status` instead of `verbose_status`. This has now been corrected so that the messages report the correct type.\r\n\r\n    [#4176](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4176) \r\n\r\n * Change #4201: Require Go 1.20 for Solaris builds\r\n\r\n   Building restic on Solaris now requires Go 1.20, as the library used to access Azure uses the mmap syscall, which is only available on Solaris starting from Go 1.20. All other platforms however continue to build with Go 1.18.\r\n\r\n    [#4201](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4201) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #426: Show progress bar during restore\r\n\r\n   The `restore` command now shows a progress report while restoring files.\r\n\r\n   Example: `[0:42]  5.76%  23 files 12.98 MiB, total 3456 files 23.54 GiB`\r\n\r\n   JSON output is now also supported.\r\n\r\n    [#426](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/426) [#3413](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3413) [#3627](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3627) [#3991](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3991) [#4314](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4314) https://forum.restic.net/t/progress-bar-for-restore/5210\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #719: Add `--retry-lock` option\r\n\r\n   This option allows specifying a duration for which restic will wait if the repository is already locked.\r\n\r\n    [#719](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/719) [#2214](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2214) [#4107](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4107) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1495: Sort snapshots by timestamp in `restic find`\r\n\r\n   The `find` command used to print snapshots in an arbitrary order. Restic now prints snapshots sorted by timestamp.\r\n\r\n    [#1495](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1495) [#4409](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4409) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1759: Add `repair index` and `repair snapshots` commands\r\n\r\n   The `rebuild-index` command has been renamed to `repair index`. The old name will still work, but is deprecated.\r\n\r\n   When a snapshot was damaged, the only option up to now was to completely forget the snapshot, even if only some unimportant files in it were damaged and other files were still fine.\r\n\r\n   Restic now has a `repair snapshots` command, which can salvage any non-damaged files and parts of files in the snapshots by removing damaged directories and missing file contents. Please note that the damaged data may still be lost and see the \"Troubleshooting\" section in the documentation for more details.\r\n\r\n    [#1759](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1759) [#1714](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1714) [#1798](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1798) [#2334](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2334) [#2876](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2876) https://forum.restic.net/t/corrupted-repo-how-to-repair/799https://forum.restic.net/t/recovery-options-for-damaged-repositories/1571\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1926: Allow certificate paths to be passed through environment variables\r\n\r\n   Restic will now read paths to certificates from the environment variables `RESTIC_CACERT` or `RESTIC_TLS_CLIENT_CERT` if `--cacert` or `--tls-client-cert` are not specified.\r\n\r\n    [#1926](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1926) [#4384](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4384) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2359: Provide multi-platform Docker images\r\n\r\n   The official Docker images are now built for the architectures linux/386, linux/amd64, linux/arm and linux/arm64.\r\n\r\n   As an alternative to the Docker Hub, the Docker images are also available on ghcr.io, the GitHub Container Registry.\r\n\r\n    [#2359](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2359) [#4269](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4269) [#4364](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4364) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2468: Add support for non-global Azure clouds\r\n\r\n   The `azure` backend previously only supported storages using the global domain `core.windows.net`. This meant that backups to other domains such as Azure China (`core.chinacloudapi.cn`) or Azure Germany (`core.cloudapi.de`) were not supported. Restic now allows overriding the global domain using the environment variable `AZURE_ENDPOINT_SUFFIX`.\r\n\r\n    [#2468](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2468) [#4387](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4387) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2679: Reduce file fragmentation for local backend\r\n\r\n   Before this change, local backend files could become fragmented. Now restic will try to preallocate space for pack files to avoid their fragmentation.\r\n\r\n    [#2679](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2679) [#3261](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3261) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3328: Reduce memory usage by up to 25%\r\n\r\n   The in-memory index has been optimized to be more garbage collection friendly. Restic now defaults to `GOGC=50` to run the Go garbage collector more frequently.\r\n\r\n    [#3328](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3328) [#4352](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4352) [#4353](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4353) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3397: Improve accuracy of ETA displayed during backup\r\n\r\n   Restic's `backup` command displayed an ETA that did not adapt when the rate of progress made during the backup changed during the course of the backup.\r\n\r\n   Restic now uses recent progress when computing the ETA. It is important to realize that the estimate may still be wrong, because restic cannot predict the future, but the hope is that the ETA will be more accurate in most cases.\r\n\r\n    [#3397](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3397) [#3563](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3563) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3624: Keep oldest snapshot when there are not enough snapshots\r\n\r\n   The `forget` command now additionally preserves the oldest snapshot if fewer snapshots than allowed by the `--keep-*` parameters would otherwise be kept. This maximizes the amount of history kept within the specified limits.\r\n\r\n    [#3624](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3624) [#4366](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4366) https://forum.restic.net/t/keeping-yearly-snapshots-policy-when-backup-began-during-the-year/4670/2\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3698: Add support for Managed / Workload Identity to `azure` backend\r\n\r\n   Restic now additionally supports authenticating to Azure using Workload Identity or Managed Identity credentials, which are automatically injected in several environments such as a managed Kubernetes cluster.\r\n\r\n    [#3698](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3698) [#4029](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4029) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3871: Support `<snapshot>:<subfolder>` syntax to select subfolders\r\n\r\n   Commands like `diff` or `restore` always worked with the full snapshot. This did not allow comparing only a specific subfolder or only restoring that folder (`restore --include subfolder` filters the restored files, but still creates the directories included in `subfolder`).\r\n\r\n   The commands `diff`, `dump`, `ls` and `restore` now support the `<snapshot>:<subfolder>` syntax, where `snapshot` is the ID of a snapshot (or the string `latest`) and `subfolder` is a path within the snapshot. The commands will then only work with the specified path of the snapshot. The `subfolder` must be a path to a folder as returned by `ls`. Two examples:\r\n\r\n   `restic restore -t target latest:/some/path` `restic diff 12345678:/some/path 90abcef:/some/path`\r\n\r\n   For debugging purposes, the `cat` command now supports `cat tree <snapshot>:<subfolder>` to return the directory metadata for the given subfolder.\r\n\r\n    [#3871](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3871) [#4334](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4334) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3941: Support `--group-by` for backup parent selection\r\n\r\n   Previously, the `backup` command by default selected the parent snapshot based on the hostname and the backup targets. When the backup path list changed, the `backup` command was unable to determine a suitable parent snapshot and had to read all files again.\r\n\r\n   The new `--group-by` option for the `backup` command allows filtering snapshots for the parent selection by `host`, `paths` and `tags`. It defaults to `host,paths` which selects the latest snapshot with hostname and paths matching those of the backup run. This matches the behavior of prior restic versions.\r\n\r\n   The new `--group-by` option should be set to the same value as passed to `forget --group-by`.\r\n\r\n    [#3941](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3941) [#4081](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4081) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #4130: Cancel current command if cache becomes unusable\r\n\r\n   If the cache directory was removed or ran out of space while restic was running, this would previously cause further caching attempts to fail and thereby drastically slow down the command execution. Now, the currently running command is instead canceled.\r\n\r\n    [#4130](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4130) [#4166](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4166) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #4159: Add `--human-readable` option to `ls` and `find` commands\r\n\r\n   Previously, when using the `-l` option with the `ls` and `find` commands, the displayed size was always in bytes, without an option for a more human readable format such as MiB or GiB.\r\n\r\n   The new `--human-readable` option will convert longer size values into more human friendly values with an appropriate suffix depending on the output size. For example, a size of `14680064` will be shown as `14.000 MiB`.\r\n\r\n    [#4159](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4159) [#4351](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4351) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #4188: Include restic version in snapshot metadata\r\n\r\n   The restic version used to backup a snapshot is now included in its metadata and shown when inspecting a snapshot using `restic cat snapshot <snapshotID>` or `restic snapshots --json`.\r\n\r\n    [#4188](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4188) [#4378](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4378) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #4220: Add `jq` binary to Docker image\r\n\r\n   The Docker image now contains `jq`, which can be useful to process JSON data output by restic.\r\n\r\n    [#4220](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4220) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #4226: Allow specifying region of new buckets in the `gs` backend\r\n\r\n   Previously, buckets used by the Google Cloud Storage backend would always get created in the \"us\" region. It is now possible to specify the region where a bucket should be created by using the `-o gs.region=us` option.\r\n\r\n    [#4226](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4226) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #4375: Add support for extended attributes on symlinks\r\n\r\n   Restic now supports extended attributes on symlinks when backing up, restoring, or FUSE-mounting snapshots. This includes, for example, the `security.selinux` xattr on Linux distributions that use SELinux.\r\n\r\n    [#4375](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4375) [#4379](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4379) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "We're very pleased to present you restic 0.15.2! This is just (another) small bugfix release.\r\n\r\nrestic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you already have restic >= 0.9.4, you can use `restic self-update` to get the latest version in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that in the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/developer_information.rst).\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.15.2 (2023-04-24)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.15.2 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Sec [#4275](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4275): Update golang.org/x/net to address CVE-2022-41723\r\n * Fix [#2260](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2260): Sanitize filenames printed by `backup` during processing\r\n * Fix [#4211](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4211): Make `dump` interpret `--host` and `--path` correctly\r\n * Fix [#4239](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4239): Correct number of blocks reported in mount point\r\n * Fix [#4253](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4253): Minimize risk of spurious filesystem loops with `mount`\r\n * Enh [#4180](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4180): Add release binaries for riscv64 architecture on Linux\r\n * Enh [#4219](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4219): Upgrade Minio to version 7.0.49\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Security #4275: Update golang.org/x/net to address CVE-2022-41723\r\n\r\n    [#4275](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4275) [#4213](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4213)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2260: Sanitize filenames printed by `backup` during processing\r\n\r\n   The `backup` command would previously not sanitize the filenames it printed during processing, potentially causing newlines or terminal control characters to mangle the status output or even change the state of a terminal.\r\n\r\n   Filenames are now checked and quoted if they contain non-printable or non-Unicode characters.\r\n\r\n    [#2260](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2260) [#4191](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4191) [#4192](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4192)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4211: Make `dump` interpret `--host` and `--path` correctly\r\n\r\n   A regression in restic 0.15.0 caused `dump` to confuse its `--host=<host>` and `--path=<path>` options: it looked for snapshots with paths called `<host>` from hosts called `<path>`. It now treats the options as intended.\r\n\r\n    [#4211](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4211) [#4212](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4212)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4239: Correct number of blocks reported in mount point\r\n\r\n   Restic mount points reported an incorrect number of 512-byte (POSIX standard) blocks for files and links due to a rounding bug. In particular, empty files were reported as taking one block instead of zero.\r\n\r\n   The rounding is now fixed: the number of blocks reported is the file size (or link target size) divided by 512 and rounded up to a whole number.\r\n\r\n    [#4239](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4239) [#4240](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4240)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4253: Minimize risk of spurious filesystem loops with `mount`\r\n\r\n   When a backup contains a directory that has the same name as its parent, say `a/b/b`, and the GNU `find` command was run on this backup in a restic mount, `find` would refuse to traverse the lowest `b` directory, instead printing `File system loop detected`. This was due to the way the restic mount command generates inode numbers for directories in the mount point.\r\n\r\n   The rule for generating these inode numbers was changed in 0.15.0. It has now been changed again to avoid this issue. A perfect rule does not exist, but the probability of this behavior occurring is now extremely small.\r\n\r\n   When it does occur, the mount point is not broken, and scripts that traverse the mount point should work as long as they don't rely on inode numbers for detecting filesystem loops.\r\n\r\n    [#4253](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4253) [#4255](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4255)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #4180: Add release binaries for riscv64 architecture on Linux\r\n\r\n   Builds for the `riscv64` architecture on Linux are now included in the release binaries.\r\n\r\n    [#4180](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4180)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #4219: Upgrade Minio to version 7.0.49\r\n\r\n   The upgraded version now allows use of the `ap-southeast-4` region (Melbourne).\r\n\r\n    [#4219](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4219)",

    "body": "We're very pleased to present you restic 0.15.1! This is just a small bugfix release, fixing some issues that arose after 0.15.0 was published.\r\n\r\nrestic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you already have restic >= 0.9.4, you can use `restic self-update` to get the latest version in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that in the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/developer_information.rst).\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.15.1 (2023-01-30)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.15.1 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#3750](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3750): Remove `b2_download_file_by_name: 404` warning from B2 backend\r\n * Fix [#4147](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4147): Make `prune --quiet` not print progress bar\r\n * Fix [#4163](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4163): Make `self-update --output` work with new filename on Windows\r\n * Fix [#4167](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4167): Add missing ETA in `backup` progress bar\r\n * Enh [#4143](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4143): Ignore empty lock files\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3750: Remove `b2_download_file_by_name: 404` warning from B2 backend\r\n\r\n   In some cases the B2 backend could print `b2_download_file_by_name: 404: : b2.b2err` warnings. These are only debug messages and can be safely ignored.\r\n\r\n   Restic now uses an updated library for accessing B2, which removes the warning.\r\n\r\n    [#3750](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3750) [#4144](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4144) [#4146](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4146)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4147: Make `prune --quiet` not print progress bar\r\n\r\n   A regression in restic 0.15.0 caused `prune --quiet` to show a progress bar while deciding how to process each pack files. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#4147](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4147) [#4153](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4153)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4163: Make `self-update --output` work with new filename on Windows\r\n\r\n   Since restic 0.14.0 the `self-update` command did not work when a custom output filename was specified via the `--output` option. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n   As a workaround, either use an older restic version to run the self-update or create an empty file with the output filename before updating e.g. using CMD:\r\n\r\n   `type nul > new-file.exe` `restic self-update --output new-file.exe`\r\n\r\n    [#4163](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4163) https://forum.restic.net/t/self-update-windows-started-failing-after-release-of-0-15/5836\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4167: Add missing ETA in `backup` progress bar\r\n\r\n   A regression in restic 0.15.0 caused the ETA to be missing from the progress bar displayed by the `backup` command. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#4167](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4167)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #4143: Ignore empty lock files\r\n\r\n   With restic 0.15.0 the checks for stale locks became much stricter than before. In particular, empty or unreadable locks were no longer silently ignored. This made restic to complain with `Load(<lock/1234567812>, 0, 0) returned error, retrying after 552.330144ms: load(<lock/1234567812>): invalid data returned` and fail in the end.\r\n\r\n   The error message is now clarified and the implementation changed to ignore empty lock files which are sometimes created as the result of a failed uploads on some backends.\r\n\r\n   Please note that unreadable lock files still have to cleaned up manually. To do so, you can run `restic unlock --remove-all` which removes all existing lock files. But first make sure that no other restic process is currently using the repository.\r\n\r\n    [#4143](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4143) [#4152](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4152)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "\r\nWe're very pleased to present you restic 0.15.0!\r\n\r\nIn this version a new [`rewrite`](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/045_working_with_repos.html#removing-files-from-snapshots) command has been implemented. This allows for removing unwanted data from existing snapshots, for example if one discovers that some files were unintentionally backed up, such as files with sensitive content or files that take up a lot of space and don't need to be backed up. Please see the [corresponding documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/045_working_with_repos.html#removing-files-from-snapshots) for more information and usage examples.\r\n\r\nrestic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you already have restic >= 0.9.4, you can use `restic self-update` to get the latest version in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that in the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/developer_information.rst).\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.15.0 (2023-01-12)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.15.0 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#2015](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2015): Make `mount` return exit code 0 after receiving Ctrl-C / SIGINT\r\n * Fix [#2578](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2578): Make `restore` replace existing symlinks\r\n * Fix [#2591](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2591): Don't read password from stdin for `backup --stdin`\r\n * Fix [#3161](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3161): Delete files on Backblaze B2 more reliably\r\n * Fix [#3336](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3336): Make SFTP backend report no space left on device\r\n * Fix [#3567](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3567): Improve handling of interrupted syscalls in `mount` command\r\n * Fix [#3897](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3897): Fix stuck `copy` command when `-o <backend>.connections=1`\r\n * Fix [#3918](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3918): Correct prune statistics for partially compressed repositories\r\n * Fix [#3951](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3951): Make `ls` return exit code 1 if snapshot cannot be loaded\r\n * Fix [#4003](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4003): Make `backup` no longer hang on Solaris when seeing a FIFO file\r\n * Fix [#4016](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4016): Support ExFAT-formatted local backends on macOS Ventura\r\n * Fix [#4085](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4085): Make `init` ignore \"Access Denied\" errors when creating S3 buckets\r\n * Fix [#4100](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4100): Make `self-update` enabled by default only in release builds\r\n * Fix [#4103](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4103): Don't generate negative UIDs and GIDs in tar files from `dump`\r\n * Chg [#2724](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2724): Include full snapshot ID in JSON output of `backup`\r\n * Chg [#3929](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3929): Make `unlock` display message only when locks were actually removed\r\n * Chg [#4033](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4033): Don't print skipped snapshots by default in `copy` command\r\n * Chg [#4041](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4041): Update dependencies and require Go 1.18 or newer\r\n * Enh [#14](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/14): Implement `rewrite` command\r\n * Enh [#79](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/79): Restore files with long runs of zeros as sparse files\r\n * Enh [#1078](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1078): Support restoring symbolic links on Windows\r\n * Enh [#1734](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1734): Inform about successful retries after errors\r\n * Enh [#1866](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1866): Improve handling of directories with duplicate entries\r\n * Enh [#2134](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2134): Support B2 API keys restricted to hiding but not deleting files\r\n * Enh [#2152](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2152): Make `init` open only one connection for the SFTP backend\r\n * Enh [#2533](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2533): Handle cache corruption on disk and in downloads\r\n * Enh [#2715](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2715): Stricter repository lock handling\r\n * Enh [#2750](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2750): Make backup file read concurrency configurable\r\n * Enh [#3029](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3029): Add support for `credential_process` to S3 backend\r\n * Enh [#3096](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3096): Make `mount` command support macOS using macFUSE 4.x\r\n * Enh [#3124](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3124): Support JSON output for the `init` command\r\n * Enh [#3899](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3899): Optimize prune memory usage\r\n * Enh [#3905](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3905): Improve speed of parent snapshot detection in `backup` command\r\n * Enh [#3915](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3915): Add compression statistics to the `stats` command\r\n * Enh [#3925](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3925/files): Provide command completion for PowerShell\r\n * Enh [#3931](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3931): Allow `backup` file tree scanner to be disabled\r\n * Enh [#3932](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3932): Improve handling of ErrDot errors in rclone and sftp backends\r\n * Enh [#3943](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3943): Ignore additional/unknown files in repository\r\n * Enh [#3955](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3955): Improve `backup` performance for small files\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2015: Make `mount` return exit code 0 after receiving Ctrl-C / SIGINT\r\n\r\n   To stop the `mount` command, a user has to press Ctrl-C or send a SIGINT signal to restic. This used to cause restic to exit with a non-zero exit code.\r\n\r\n   The exit code has now been changed to zero as the above is the expected way to stop the `mount` command and should therefore be considered successful.\r\n\r\n    [#2015](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2015) [#3894](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3894)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2578: Make `restore` replace existing symlinks\r\n\r\n   When restoring a symlink, restic used to report an error if the target path already existed. This has now been fixed such that the potentially existing target path is first removed before the symlink is restored.\r\n\r\n    [#2578](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2578) [#3780](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3780)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2591: Don't read password from stdin for `backup --stdin`\r\n\r\n   The `backup` command when used with `--stdin` previously tried to read first the password, then the data to be backed up from standard input. This meant it would often confuse part of the data for the password.\r\n\r\n   From now on, it will instead exit with the message `Fatal: cannot read both password and data from stdin` unless the password is passed in some other way (such as `--restic-password-file`, `RESTIC_PASSWORD`, etc).\r\n\r\n   To enter the password interactively a password command has to be used. For example on Linux, `mysqldump somedatabase | restic backup --stdin --password-command='sh -c \"systemd-ask-password < /dev/tty\"'` securely reads the password from the terminal.\r\n\r\n    [#2591](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2591) [#4011](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4011)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3161: Delete files on Backblaze B2 more reliably\r\n\r\n   Restic used to only delete the latest version of files stored in B2. In most cases this worked well as there was only a single version of the file. However, due to retries while uploading it is possible for multiple file versions to be stored at B2. This could lead to various problems for files that should have been deleted but still existed.\r\n\r\n   The implementation has now been changed to delete all versions of files, which doubles the amount of Class B transactions necessary to delete files, but assures that no file versions are left behind.\r\n\r\n    [#3161](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3161) [#3885](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3885)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3336: Make SFTP backend report no space left on device\r\n\r\n   Backing up to an SFTP backend would spew repeated SSH_FX_FAILURE messages when the remote disk was full. Restic now reports \"sftp: no space left on device\" and exits immediately when it detects this condition.\r\n\r\n   A fix for this issue was implemented in restic 0.12.1, but unfortunately the fix itself contained a bug that prevented it from taking effect.\r\n\r\n    [#3336](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3336) [#3345](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3345) [#4075](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4075)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3567: Improve handling of interrupted syscalls in `mount` command\r\n\r\n   Accessing restic's FUSE mount could result in \"input/output\" errors when using programs in which syscalls can be interrupted. This is for example the case for Go programs. This has now been fixed by improved error handling of interrupted syscalls.\r\n\r\n    [#3567](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3567) [#3694](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3694) [#3875](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3875)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3897: Fix stuck `copy` command when `-o <backend>.connections=1`\r\n\r\n   When running the `copy` command with `-o <backend>.connections=1` the command would be infinitely stuck. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#3897](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3897) [#3898](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3898)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3918: Correct prune statistics for partially compressed repositories\r\n\r\n   In a partially compressed repository, one data blob can exist both in an uncompressed and a compressed version. This caused the `prune` statistics to become inaccurate and e.g. report a too high value for the unused size, such as \"unused size after prune: 16777215.991 TiB\". This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#3918](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3918) [#3980](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3980)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3951: Make `ls` return exit code 1 if snapshot cannot be loaded\r\n\r\n   The `ls` command used to show a warning and return exit code 0 when failing to load a snapshot. This has now been fixed such that it instead returns exit code 1 (still showing a warning).\r\n\r\n    [#3951](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3951)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4003: Make `backup` no longer hang on Solaris when seeing a FIFO file\r\n\r\n   The `backup` command used to hang on Solaris whenever it encountered a FIFO file (named pipe), due to a bug in the handling of extended attributes. This bug has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#4003](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4003) [#4053](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4053)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4016: Support ExFAT-formatted local backends on macOS Ventura\r\n\r\n   ExFAT-formatted disks could not be used as local backends starting from macOS Ventura. Restic commands would fail with an \"inappropriate ioctl for device\" error. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#4016](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4016) [#4021](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4021)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4085: Make `init` ignore \"Access Denied\" errors when creating S3 buckets\r\n\r\n   In restic 0.9.0 through 0.13.0, the `init` command ignored some permission errors from S3 backends when trying to check for bucket existence, so that manually created buckets with custom permissions could be used for backups.\r\n\r\n   This feature became broken in 0.14.0, but has now been restored again.\r\n\r\n    [#4085](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4085) [#4086](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4086)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4100: Make `self-update` enabled by default only in release builds\r\n\r\n   The `self-update` command was previously included by default in all builds of restic as opposed to only in official release builds, even if the `selfupdate` tag was not explicitly enabled when building.\r\n\r\n   This has now been corrected, and the `self-update` command is only available if restic was built with `-tags selfupdate` (as done for official release builds by `build.go`).\r\n\r\n    [#4100](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4100)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #4103: Don't generate negative UIDs and GIDs in tar files from `dump`\r\n\r\n   When using a 32-bit build of restic, the `dump` command could in some cases create tar files containing negative UIDs and GIDs, which cannot be read by GNU tar. This corner case especially applies to backups from stdin on Windows.\r\n\r\n   This is now fixed such that `dump` creates valid tar files in these cases too.\r\n\r\n    [#4103](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4103) [#4104](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4104)\r\n\r\n * Change #2724: Include full snapshot ID in JSON output of `backup`\r\n\r\n   We have changed the JSON output of the backup command to include the full snapshot ID instead of just a shortened version, as the latter can be ambiguous in some rare cases. To derive the short ID, please truncate the full ID down to eight characters.\r\n\r\n    [#2724](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2724) [#3993](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3993)\r\n\r\n * Change #3929: Make `unlock` display message only when locks were actually removed\r\n\r\n   The `unlock` command used to print the \"successfully removed locks\" message whenever it was run, regardless of lock files having being removed or not.\r\n\r\n   This has now been changed such that it only prints the message if any lock files were actually removed. In addition, it also reports the number of removed lock files.\r\n\r\n    [#3929](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3929) [#3935](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3935)\r\n\r\n * Change #4033: Don't print skipped snapshots by default in `copy` command\r\n\r\n   The `copy` command used to print each snapshot that was skipped because it already existed in the target repository. The amount of this output could practically bury the list of snapshots that were actually copied.\r\n\r\n   From now on, the skipped snapshots are by default not printed at all, but this can be re-enabled by increasing the verbosity level of the command.\r\n\r\n    [#4033](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4033) [#4066](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4066)\r\n\r\n * Change #4041: Update dependencies and require Go 1.18 or newer\r\n\r\n   Most dependencies have been updated. Since some libraries require newer language features, support for Go 1.15-1.17 has been dropped, which means that restic now requires at least Go 1.18 to build.\r\n\r\n    [#4041](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4041)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #14: Implement `rewrite` command\r\n\r\n   Restic now has a `rewrite` command which allows to rewrite existing snapshots to remove unwanted files.\r\n\r\n    [#14](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/14) [#2731](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2731) [#4079](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4079)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #79: Restore files with long runs of zeros as sparse files\r\n\r\n   When using `restore --sparse`, the restorer may now write files containing long runs of zeros as sparse files (also called files with holes), where the zeros are not actually written to disk.\r\n\r\n   How much space is saved by writing sparse files depends on the operating system, file system and the distribution of zeros in the file.\r\n\r\n   During backup restic still reads the whole file including sparse regions, but with optimized processing speed of sparse regions.\r\n\r\n    [#79](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/79) [#3903](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3903) [#2601](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2601) [#3854](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3854) https://forum.restic.net/t/sparse-file-support/1264\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1078: Support restoring symbolic links on Windows\r\n\r\n   The `restore` command now supports restoring symbolic links on Windows. Because of Windows specific restrictions this is only possible when running restic with the `SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege` privilege or as an administrator.\r\n\r\n    [#1078](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1078) [#2699](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2699) [#2875](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2875)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1734: Inform about successful retries after errors\r\n\r\n   When a recoverable error is encountered, restic shows a warning message saying that it's retrying, e.g.:\r\n\r\n   `Save(<data/956b9ced99>) returned error, retrying after 357.131936ms: ...`\r\n\r\n   This message can be confusing in that it never clearly states whether the retry is successful or not. This has now been fixed such that restic follows up with a message confirming a successful retry, e.g.:\r\n\r\n   `Save(<data/956b9ced99>) operation successful after 1 retries`\r\n\r\n    [#1734](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1734) [#2661](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2661)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1866: Improve handling of directories with duplicate entries\r\n\r\n   If for some reason a directory contains a duplicate entry, the `backup` command would previously fail with a `node \"path/to/file\" already present` or `nodes are not ordered got \"path/to/file\", last \"path/to/file\"` error.\r\n\r\n   The error handling has been improved to only report a warning in this case. Make sure to check that the filesystem in question is not damaged if you see this!\r\n\r\n    [#1866](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1866) [#3937](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3937) [#3880](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3880)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2134: Support B2 API keys restricted to hiding but not deleting files\r\n\r\n   When the B2 backend does not have the necessary permissions to permanently delete files, it now automatically falls back to hiding files. This allows using restic with an application key which is not allowed to delete files. This can prevent an attacker from deleting backups with such an API key.\r\n\r\n   To use this feature create an application key without the `deleteFiles` capability. It is recommended to restrict the key to just one bucket. For example using the `b2` command line tool:\r\n\r\n   `b2 create-key --bucket <bucketName> <keyName> listBuckets,readFiles,writeFiles,listFiles`\r\n\r\n   Alternatively, you can use the S3 backend to access B2, as described in the documentation. In this mode, files are also only hidden instead of being deleted permanently.\r\n\r\n    [#2134](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2134) [#2398](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2398)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2152: Make `init` open only one connection for the SFTP backend\r\n\r\n   The `init` command using the SFTP backend used to connect twice to the repository. This could be inconvenient if the user must enter a password, or cause `init` to fail if the server does not correctly close the first SFTP connection.\r\n\r\n   This has now been fixed by reusing the first/initial SFTP connection opened.\r\n\r\n    [#2152](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2152) [#3882](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3882)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2533: Handle cache corruption on disk and in downloads\r\n\r\n   In rare situations, like for example after a system crash, the data stored in the cache might be corrupted. This could cause restic to fail and required manually deleting the cache.\r\n\r\n   Restic now automatically removes broken data from the cache, allowing it to recover from such a situation without user intervention. In addition, restic retries downloads which return corrupt data in order to also handle temporary download problems.\r\n\r\n    [#2533](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2533) [#3521](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3521)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2715: Stricter repository lock handling\r\n\r\n   Previously, restic commands kept running even if they failed to refresh their locks in time. This could be a problem e.g. in case the client system running a backup entered the standby power mode while the backup was still in progress (which would prevent the client from refreshing its lock), and after a short delay another host successfully runs `unlock` and `prune` on the repository, which would remove all data added by the in-progress backup. If the backup client later continues its backup, even though its lock had expired in the meantime, this would lead to an incomplete snapshot.\r\n\r\n   To address this, lock handling is now much stricter. Commands requiring a lock are canceled if the lock is not refreshed successfully in time. In addition, if a lock file is not readable restic will not allow starting a command. It may be necessary to remove invalid lock files manually or use `unlock --remove-all`. Please make sure that no other restic processes are running concurrently before doing this, however.\r\n\r\n    [#2715](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2715) [#3569](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3569)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2750: Make backup file read concurrency configurable\r\n\r\n   The `backup` command now supports a `--read-concurrency` option which allows tuning restic for very fast storage like NVMe disks by controlling the number of concurrent file reads during the backup process.\r\n\r\n    [#2750](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2750)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3029: Add support for `credential_process` to S3 backend\r\n\r\n   Restic now uses a newer library for the S3 backend, which adds support for the `credential_process` option in the AWS credential configuration.\r\n\r\n    [#3029](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3029) [#4034](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/4034) [#4025](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4025)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3096: Make `mount` command support macOS using macFUSE 4.x\r\n\r\n   Restic now uses a different FUSE library for mounting snapshots and making them available as a FUSE filesystem using the `mount` command. This adds support for macFUSE 4.x which can be used to make this work on recent macOS versions.\r\n\r\n    [#3096](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3096) [#4024](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/4024)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3124: Support JSON output for the `init` command\r\n\r\n   The `init` command used to ignore the `--json` option, but now outputs a JSON message if the repository was created successfully.\r\n\r\n    [#3124](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3124) [#3132](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3132)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3899: Optimize prune memory usage\r\n\r\n   The `prune` command needs large amounts of memory in order to determine what to keep and what to remove. This is now optimized to use up to 30% less memory.\r\n\r\n    [#3899](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3899)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3905: Improve speed of parent snapshot detection in `backup` command\r\n\r\n   Backing up a large number of files using `--files-from-verbatim` or `--files-from-raw` options could require a long time to find the parent snapshot. This has been improved.\r\n\r\n    [#3905](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3905)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3915: Add compression statistics to the `stats` command\r\n\r\n   When executed with `--mode raw-data` on a repository that supports compression, the `stats` command now calculates and displays, for the selected repository or snapshots: the uncompressed size of the data; the compression progress (percentage of data that has been compressed); the compression ratio of the compressed data; the total space saving.\r\n\r\n   It also takes into account both the compressed and uncompressed data if the repository is only partially compressed.\r\n\r\n    [#3915](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3915)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3925: Provide command completion for PowerShell\r\n\r\n   Restic already provided generation of completion files for bash, fish and zsh. Now powershell is supported, too.\r\n\r\n    [#3925](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3925)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3931: Allow `backup` file tree scanner to be disabled\r\n\r\n   The `backup` command walks the file tree in a separate scanner process to find the total size and file/directory count, and uses this to provide an ETA. This can slow down backups, especially of network filesystems.\r\n\r\n   The command now has a new option `--no-scan` which can be used to disable this scanning in order to speed up backups when needed.\r\n\r\n    [#3931](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3931)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3932: Improve handling of ErrDot errors in rclone and sftp backends\r\n\r\n   Since Go 1.19, restic can no longer implicitly run relative executables which are found in the current directory (e.g. `rclone` if found in `.`). This is a security feature of Go to prevent against running unintended and possibly harmful executables.\r\n\r\n   The error message for this was just \"cannot run executable found relative to current directory\". This has now been improved to yield a more specific error message, informing the user how to explicitly allow running the executable using the `-o rclone.program` and `-o sftp.command` extended options with `./`.\r\n\r\n    [#3932](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3932) https://pkg.go.dev/os/exec#hdr-Executables_in_the_current_directoryhttps://go.dev/blog/path-security\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3943: Ignore additional/unknown files in repository\r\n\r\n   If a restic repository had additional files in it (not created by restic), commands like `find` and `restore` could become confused and fail with an `multiple IDs with prefix \"12345678\" found` error. These commands now ignore such additional files.\r\n\r\n    [#3943](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3943) https://forum.restic.net/t/which-protocol-should-i-choose-for-remote-linux-backups/5446/17\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3955: Improve `backup` performance for small files\r\n\r\n   When backing up small files restic was slower than it could be. In particular this affected backups using maximum compression.\r\n\r\n   This has been fixed by reworking the internal parallelism of the backup command, making it back up small files around two times faster.\r\n\r\n    [#3955](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3955)\r\n",

    "body": "\r\nWe're very pleased to present you restic 0.14.0! This is a great release which introduces a new repository version that adds **the** most requested feature: compression!\r\n\r\nrestic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you already have restic >= 0.9.4, you can use `restic self-update` to get the latest version in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that in the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/developer_information.rst).\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.14.0 (2022-08-25)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.14.0 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#2248](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2248): Support `self-update` on Windows\r\n * Fix [#3428](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3428): List snapshots in backend at most once to resolve snapshot IDs\r\n * Fix [#3432](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3432): Fix rare 'not found in repository' error for `copy` command\r\n * Fix [#3685](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3685): The `diff` command incorrectly listed some files as added\r\n * Fix [#3681](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3681): Fix rclone (shimmed by Scoop) and sftp not working on Windows\r\n * Fix [#3720](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3720): Directory sync errors for repositories accessed via SMB\r\n * Fix [#3736](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3736): The `stats` command miscalculated restore size for multiple snapshots\r\n * Fix [#3861](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3861): Yield error on invalid policy to `forget`\r\n * Fix [#3716](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3716): Print \"wrong password\" to stderr instead of stdout\r\n * Fix [#3772](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3772): Correctly rebuild index for legacy repositories\r\n * Fix [#3776](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3776): Limit number of key files tested while opening a repository\r\n * Chg [#1842](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1842): Support debug log creation in release builds\r\n * Chg [#3295](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3295): Deprecate `check --check-unused` and add further checks\r\n * Chg [#3680](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3680): Update dependencies and require Go 1.15 or newer\r\n * Chg [#3742](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3742): Replace `--repo2` option used by `init`/`copy` with `--from-repo`\r\n * Enh [#1153](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1153): Support pruning even when the disk is full\r\n * Enh [#21](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/21): Add compression support\r\n * Enh [#2162](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2162): Adaptive IO concurrency based on backend connections\r\n * Enh [#2291](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2291): Allow pack size customization\r\n * Enh [#2295](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2295): Allow use of SAS token to authenticate to Azure\r\n * Enh [#2696](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2696): Improve backup speed with many small files\r\n * Enh [#2907](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2907): Make snapshot directory structure of `mount` command customizable\r\n * Enh [#3114](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3114): Optimize handling of duplicate blobs in `prune`\r\n * Enh [#3465](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3465): Improve handling of temporary files on Windows\r\n * Enh [#3709](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3709): Validate exclude patterns before backing up\r\n * Enh [#3837](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3837): Improve SFTP repository initialization over slow links\r\n * Enh [#2351](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2351): Use config file permissions to control file group access\r\n * Enh [#3475](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3475): Allow limiting IO concurrency for local and SFTP backend\r\n * Enh [#3484](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3484): Stream data in `check` and `prune` commands\r\n * Enh [#2923](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2923): Improve speed of `copy` command\r\n * Enh [#3729](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3729): Display full IDs in `check` warnings\r\n * Enh [#3773](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3773): Optimize memory usage for directories with many files\r\n * Enh [#3819](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3819): Validate include/exclude patterns before restoring\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2248: Support `self-update` on Windows\r\n\r\n   Restic `self-update` would fail in situations where the operating system locks running binaries, including Windows. The new behavior works around this by renaming the running file and swapping the updated file in place.\r\n\r\n    [#2248](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2248) [#3675](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3675)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3428: List snapshots in backend at most once to resolve snapshot IDs\r\n\r\n   Many commands support specifying a list of snapshot IDs which are then used to determine the snapshots to be processed by the command. To resolve snapshot IDs or `latest`, and check that these exist, restic previously listed all snapshots stored in the repository. Depending on the backend this could be a slow and/or expensive operation.\r\n\r\n   Restic now lists the snapshots only once and remembers the result in order to resolve all further snapshot IDs swiftly.\r\n\r\n    [#3428](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3428) [#3570](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3570) [#3395](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3395)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3432: Fix rare 'not found in repository' error for `copy` command\r\n\r\n   In rare cases `copy` (and other commands) would report that `LoadTree(...)` returned an `id [...] not found in repository` error. This could be caused by a backup or copy command running concurrently. The error was only temporary; running the failed restic command a second time as a workaround did resolve the error.\r\n\r\n   This issue has now been fixed by correcting the order in which restic reads data from the repository. It is now guaranteed that restic only loads snapshots for which all necessary data is already available.\r\n\r\n    [#3432](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3432) [#3570](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3570)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3685: The `diff` command incorrectly listed some files as added\r\n\r\n   There was a bug in the `diff` command, causing it to always show files in a removed directory as added. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#3685](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3685) [#3686](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3686)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3681: Fix rclone (shimmed by Scoop) and sftp not working on Windows\r\n\r\n   In #3602 a fix was introduced to address the problem of `rclone` prematurely exiting when Ctrl+C is pressed on Windows. The solution was to create the subprocess with its console detached from the restic console.\r\n\r\n   However, this solution failed when using `rclone` installed by Scoop or using `sftp` with a passphrase-protected private key. We've now fixed this by using a different approach to prevent Ctrl-C from passing down too early.\r\n\r\n    [#3681](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3681) [#3692](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3692) [#3696](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3696)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3720: Directory sync errors for repositories accessed via SMB\r\n\r\n   On Linux and macOS, accessing a repository via a SMB/CIFS mount resulted in restic failing to save the lock file, yielding the following errors:\r\n\r\n   Save(<lock/071fe833f0>) returned error, retrying after 552.330144ms: sync /repo/locks: no such file or directory Save(<lock/bf789d7343>) returned error, retrying after 552.330144ms: sync /repo/locks: invalid argument\r\n\r\n   This has now been fixed by ignoring the relevant error codes.\r\n\r\n    [#3720](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3720) [#3751](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3751) [#3752](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3752)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3736: The `stats` command miscalculated restore size for multiple snapshots\r\n\r\n   Since restic 0.10.0 the restore size calculated by the `stats` command for multiple snapshots was too low. The hardlink detection was accidentally applied across multiple snapshots and thus ignored many files. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#3736](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3736) [#3740](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3740)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3861: Yield error on invalid policy to `forget`\r\n\r\n   The `forget` command previously silently ignored invalid/unsupported units in the duration options, such as e.g. `--keep-within-daily 2w`.\r\n\r\n   Specifying an invalid/unsupported duration unit now results in an error.\r\n\r\n    [#3861](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3861) [#3862](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3862)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3716: Print \"wrong password\" to stderr instead of stdout\r\n\r\n   If an invalid password was entered, the error message was printed on stdout and not on stderr as intended. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#3716](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3716) https://forum.restic.net/t/4965\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3772: Correctly rebuild index for legacy repositories\r\n\r\n   After running `rebuild-index` on a legacy repository containing mixed pack files (that is, pack files which store both metadata and file data), `check` printed warnings like `pack 12345678 contained in several indexes: ...`. This warning was not critical, but has now nonetheless been fixed by properly handling mixed pack files while rebuilding the index.\r\n\r\n   Running `prune` for such legacy repositories will also fix the warning by reorganizing the pack files which caused it.\r\n\r\n    [#3772](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3772) [#3884](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3884) https://forum.restic.net/t/5044/13\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3776: Limit number of key files tested while opening a repository\r\n\r\n   Previously, restic tested the password against every key in the repository when opening a repository. The more keys there were in the repository, the slower this operation became.\r\n\r\n   Restic now tests the password against up to 20 key files in the repository. Alternatively, you can use the `--key-hint=<key ID>` option to specify a specific key file to use instead.\r\n\r\n    [#3776](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3776)\r\n\r\n * Change #1842: Support debug log creation in release builds\r\n\r\n   Creating a debug log was only possible in debug builds which required users to manually build restic. We changed the release builds to allow creating debug logs by simply setting the environment variable `DEBUG_LOG=logname.log`.\r\n\r\n    [#1842](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1842) [#3826](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3826)\r\n\r\n * Change #3295: Deprecate `check --check-unused` and add further checks\r\n\r\n   Since restic 0.12.0, it is expected to still have unused blobs after running `prune`. This made the `--check-unused` option of the `check` command rather useless and tended to confuse users. This option has been deprecated and is now ignored.\r\n\r\n   The `check` command now also warns if a repository is using either the legacy S3 layout or mixed pack files with both tree and data blobs. The latter is known to cause performance problems.\r\n\r\n    [#3295](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3295) [#3730](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3730)\r\n\r\n * Change #3680: Update dependencies and require Go 1.15 or newer\r\n\r\n   We've updated most dependencies. Since some libraries require newer language features we're dropping support for Go 1.14, which means that restic now requires at least Go 1.15 to build.\r\n\r\n    [#3680](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3680) [#3883](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3883)\r\n\r\n * Change #3742: Replace `--repo2` option used by `init`/`copy` with `--from-repo`\r\n\r\n   The `init` and `copy` commands can read data from another repository. However, confusingly `--repo2` referred to the repository *from* which the `init` command copies parameters, but for the `copy` command `--repo2` referred to the copy *destination*.\r\n\r\n   We've introduced a new option, `--from-repo`, which always refers to the source repository for both commands. The old parameter names have been deprecated but still work. To create a new repository and copy all snapshots to it, the commands are now as follows:\r\n\r\n   ``` restic -r /srv/restic-repo-copy init --from-repo /srv/restic-repo --copy-chunker-params restic -r /srv/restic-repo-copy copy --from-repo /srv/restic-repo ```\r\n\r\n    [#3742](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3742) https://forum.restic.net/t/5017\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1153: Support pruning even when the disk is full\r\n\r\n   When running out of disk space it was no longer possible to add or remove data from a repository. To help with recovering from such a deadlock, the prune command now supports an `--unsafe-recover-no-free-space` option to recover from these situations. Make sure to read the documentation first!\r\n\r\n    [#1153](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1153) [#3481](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3481)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #21: Add compression support\r\n\r\n   We've added compression support to the restic repository format. To create a repository using the new format run `init --repository-version 2`. Please note that the repository cannot be read by restic versions prior to 0.14.0.\r\n\r\n   You can configure whether data is compressed with the option `--compression`. It can be set to `auto` (the default, which will compress very fast), `max` (which will trade backup speed and CPU usage for better compression), or `off` (which disables compression). Each setting is only applied for the current run of restic and does *not* apply to future runs. The option can also be set via the environment variable `RESTIC_COMPRESSION`.\r\n\r\n   To upgrade in place run `migrate upgrade_repo_v2` followed by `prune`. See the documentation for more details. The migration checks the repository integrity and upgrades the repository format, but will not change any data. Afterwards, prune will rewrite the metadata to make use of compression.\r\n\r\n   As an alternative you can use the `copy` command to migrate snapshots; First create a new repository using `init --repository-version 2 --copy-chunker-params --repo2 path/to/old/repo`, and then use the `copy` command to copy all snapshots to the new repository.\r\n\r\n    [#21](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/21) [#3779](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3779) [#3666](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3666) [#3704](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3704) [#3733](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3733)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2162: Adaptive IO concurrency based on backend connections\r\n\r\n   Many commands used hard-coded limits for the number of concurrent operations. This prevented speed improvements by increasing the number of connections used by a backend.\r\n\r\n   These limits have now been replaced by using the configured number of backend connections instead, which can be controlled using the `-o <backend-name>.connections=5` option. Commands will then automatically scale their parallelism accordingly.\r\n\r\n   To limit the number of CPU cores used by restic, you can set the environment variable `GOMAXPROCS` accordingly. For example to use a single CPU core, use `GOMAXPROCS=1`.\r\n\r\n    [#2162](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2162) [#1467](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1467) [#3611](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3611)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2291: Allow pack size customization\r\n\r\n   Restic now uses a target pack size of 16 MiB by default. This can be customized using the `--pack-size size` option. Supported pack sizes range between 4 and 128 MiB.\r\n\r\n   It is possible to migrate an existing repository to _larger_ pack files using `prune --repack-small`. This will rewrite every pack file which is significantly smaller than the target size.\r\n\r\n    [#2291](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2291) [#3731](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3731)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2295: Allow use of SAS token to authenticate to Azure\r\n\r\n   Previously restic only supported AccountKeys to authenticate to Azure storage accounts, which necessitates giving a significant amount of access.\r\n\r\n   We added support for Azure SAS tokens which are a more fine-grained and time-limited manner of granting access. Set the `AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME` and `AZURE_ACCOUNT_SAS` environment variables to use a SAS token for authentication. Note that if `AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY` is set, it will take precedence.\r\n\r\n    [#2295](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2295) [#3661](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3661)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2696: Improve backup speed with many small files\r\n\r\n   We have restructured the backup pipeline to continue reading files while all upload connections are busy. This allows the backup to already prepare the next data file such that the upload can continue as soon as a connection becomes available. This can especially improve the backup performance for high latency backends.\r\n\r\n   The upload concurrency is now controlled using the `-o <backend-name>.connections=5` option.\r\n\r\n    [#2696](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2696) [#3489](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3489)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2907: Make snapshot directory structure of `mount` command customizable\r\n\r\n   We've added the possibility to customize the snapshot directory structure of the `mount` command using templates passed to the `--snapshot-template` option. The formatting of snapshots' timestamps is now controlled using `--time-template` and supports subdirectories to for example group snapshots by year. Please see `restic help mount` for further details.\r\n\r\n   Characters in tag names which are not allowed in a filename are replaced by underscores `_`. For example a tag `foo/bar` will result in a directory name of `foo_bar`.\r\n\r\n    [#2907](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2907) [#2913](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2913) [#3691](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3691)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3114: Optimize handling of duplicate blobs in `prune`\r\n\r\n   Restic `prune` always used to repack all data files containing duplicate blobs. This effectively removed all duplicates during prune. However, as a consequence all these data files were repacked even if the unused repository space threshold could be reached with less work.\r\n\r\n   This is now changed and `prune` works nice and fast even when there are lots of duplicate blobs.\r\n\r\n    [#3114](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3114) [#3290](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3290)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3465: Improve handling of temporary files on Windows\r\n\r\n   In some cases restic failed to delete temporary files, causing the current command to fail. This has now been fixed by ensuring that Windows automatically deletes the file. In addition, temporary files are only written to disk when necessary, reducing disk writes.\r\n\r\n    [#3465](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3465) [#1551](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1551) [#3610](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3610)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3709: Validate exclude patterns before backing up\r\n\r\n   Exclude patterns provided via `--exclude`, `--iexclude`, `--exclude-file` or `--iexclude-file` previously weren't validated. As a consequence, invalid patterns resulted in files that were meant to be excluded being backed up.\r\n\r\n   Restic now validates all patterns before running the backup and aborts with a fatal error if an invalid pattern is detected.\r\n\r\n    [#3709](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3709) [#3734](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3734)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3837: Improve SFTP repository initialization over slow links\r\n\r\n   The `init` command, when used on an SFTP backend, now sends multiple `mkdir` commands to the backend concurrently. This reduces the waiting times when creating a repository over a very slow connection.\r\n\r\n    [#3837](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3837) [#3840](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3840)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2351: Use config file permissions to control file group access\r\n\r\n   Previously files in a local/SFTP repository would always end up with very restrictive access permissions, allowing access only to the owner. This prevented a number of valid use-cases involving groups and ACLs.\r\n\r\n   We now use the permissions of the config file in the repository to decide whether group access should be given to newly created repository files or not. We arrange for repository files to be created group readable exactly when the repository config file is group readable.\r\n\r\n   To opt-in to group readable repositories, a simple `chmod -R g+r` or equivalent on the config file can be used. For repositories that should be writable by group members a tad more setup is required, see the docs.\r\n\r\n   Posix ACLs can also be used now that the group permissions being forced to zero no longer masks the effect of ACL entries.\r\n\r\n    [#2351](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2351) [#3419](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3419) https://forum.restic.net/t/1391\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3475: Allow limiting IO concurrency for local and SFTP backend\r\n\r\n   Restic did not support limiting the IO concurrency / number of connections for accessing repositories stored using the local or SFTP backends. The number of connections is now limited as for other backends, and can be configured via the `-o local.connections=2` and `-o sftp.connections=5` options. This ensures that restic does not overwhelm the backend with concurrent IO operations.\r\n\r\n    [#3475](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3475)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3484: Stream data in `check` and `prune` commands\r\n\r\n   The commands `check --read-data` and `prune` previously downloaded data files into temporary files which could end up being written to disk. This could cause a large amount of data being written to disk.\r\n\r\n   The pack files are now instead streamed, which removes the need for temporary files. Please note that *uploads* during `backup` and `prune` still require temporary files.\r\n\r\n    [#3710](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3710) [#3484](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3484) [#3717](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3717)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2923: Improve speed of `copy` command\r\n\r\n   The `copy` command could require a long time to copy snapshots for non-local backends. This has been improved to provide a throughput comparable to the `restore` command.\r\n\r\n   Additionally, `copy` now displays a progress bar.\r\n\r\n    [#2923](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2923) [#3513](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3513)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3729: Display full IDs in `check` warnings\r\n\r\n   When running commands to inspect or repair a damaged repository, it is often necessary to supply the full IDs of objects stored in the repository.\r\n\r\n   The output of `check` now includes full IDs instead of their shortened variant.\r\n\r\n    [#3729](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3729)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3773: Optimize memory usage for directories with many files\r\n\r\n   Backing up a directory with hundreds of thousands or more files caused restic to require large amounts of memory. We've now optimized the `backup` command such that it requires up to 30% less memory.\r\n\r\n    [#3773](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3773)\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3819: Validate include/exclude patterns before restoring\r\n\r\n   Patterns provided to `restore` via `--exclude`, `--iexclude`, `--include` and `--iinclude` weren't validated before running the restore. Invalid patterns would result in error messages being printed repeatedly, and possibly unwanted files being restored.\r\n\r\n   Restic now validates all patterns before running the restore, and aborts with a fatal error if an invalid pattern is detected.\r\n\r\n    [#3819](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3819)\r\n",

    "body": "We're very pleased to present you restic 0.13.1! This is a small bugfix release which fixes two issues that were discovered right after 0.13.0.\r\n\r\nrestic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you already have restic >= 0.9.4, you can use `restic self-update` to get the latest version in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that in the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/developer_information.rst).\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.13.1 (2022-04-10)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.13.1 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#3685](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3685): Fix the diff command\r\n * Fix [#3681](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3681): Fix rclone (shimmed by Scoop) and sftp stopped working on Windows\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3685: Fix the diff command\r\n\r\n   There was a bug in the `diff` command, it would always show files in a removed directory as added. We've fixed that.\r\n\r\n    [#3685](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3685) [#3686](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3686) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3681: Fix rclone (shimmed by Scoop) and sftp stopped working on Windows\r\n\r\n   In #3602 a fix was introduced to fix the problem that rclone prematurely exits when Ctrl+C is pressed on Windows. The solution was to create the subprocess with its console detached from the restic console. However, such solution fails when using rclone install by scoop or using sftp with a passphrase- protected private key. We've fixed that by using a different approach to prevent Ctrl-C from passing down too early.\r\n\r\n    [#3681](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3681) [#3692](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3692) [#3696](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3696) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "We're very pleased to present you restic 0.13.0! restic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you already have restic >= 0.9.4, you can use `restic self-update` to get the latest version in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release.

This had the problem that it wouldn't work for an exclusively locked repository and that the command would also display its own lock file which can be confusing.\r\n\r\n   Now, the `list locks` command never locks the repository.\r\n\r\n    [#1106](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1106) [#3665](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3665) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2345: Make cache crash-resistant and usable by multiple concurrent processes\r\n\r\n   The restic cache directory (`RESTIC_CACHE_DIR`) could end up in a broken state in the event of restic (or the OS) crashing. This is now less likely to occur as files are downloaded to a temporary location before being moved to their proper location.\r\n\r\n   This also allows multiple concurrent restic processes to operate on a single repository without conflicts. Previously, concurrent operations could cause segfaults because the processes saw each other's partially downloaded files.\r\n\r\n    [#2345](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2345) [#2838](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2838) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2452: Improve error handling of repository locking\r\n\r\n   Previously, when the lock refresh failed to delete the old lock file, it forgot about the newly created one. Instead it continued trying to delete the old (usually no longer existing) lock file and thus over time lots of lock files accumulated. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#2452](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2452) [#2473](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2473) [#2562](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2562) [#3512](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3512) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2738: Don't print progress for `backup --json --quiet`\r\n\r\n   Unlike the text output, the `--json` output format still printed progress information even in `--quiet` mode. This has now been fixed by always disabling the progress output in quiet mode.\r\n\r\n    [#2738](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2738) [#3264](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3264) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3382: Make `check` command honor `RESTIC_CACHE_DIR` environment variable\r\n\r\n   Previously, the `check` command didn't honor the `RESTIC_CACHE_DIR` environment variable, which caused problems in certain system/usage configurations. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#3382](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3382) [#3474](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3474) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3518: Make `copy` command honor `--no-lock` for source repository\r\n\r\n   The `copy` command previously did not respect the `--no-lock` option for the source repository, causing failures with read-only storage backends. This has now been fixed such that the option is now respected.\r\n\r\n    [#3518](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3518) [#3589](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3589) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3556: Fix hang with Backblaze B2 on SSL certificate authority error\r\n\r\n   Previously, if a request failed with an SSL unknown certificate authority error, the B2 backend retried indefinitely and restic would appear to hang.\r\n\r\n   This has now been fixed and restic instead fails with an error message.\r\n\r\n    [#3556](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3556) [#2355](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2355) [#3571](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3571) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3601: Fix rclone backend prematurely exiting when receiving SIGINT on Windows\r\n\r\n   Previously, pressing Ctrl+C in a Windows console where restic was running with rclone as the backend would cause rclone to exit prematurely due to getting a `SIGINT` signal at the same time as restic. Restic would then wait for a long time for time with \"unexpected EOF\" and \"rclone stdio connection already closed\" errors.\r\n\r\n   This has now been fixed by restic starting the rclone process detached from the console restic runs in (similar to starting processes in a new process group on Linux), which enables restic to gracefully clean up rclone (which now never gets the `SIGINT`).\r\n\r\n    [#3601](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3601) [#3602](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3602) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3667: The `mount` command now reports symlinks sizes\r\n\r\n   Symlinks used to have size zero in restic mountpoints, confusing some third-party tools. They now have a size equal to the byte length of their target path, as required by POSIX.\r\n\r\n    [#3667](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3667) [#3668](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3668) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3488: `rebuild-index` failed if an index file was damaged\r\n\r\n   Previously, the `rebuild-index` command would fail with an error if an index file was damaged or truncated. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n   On older restic versions, a (slow) workaround is to use `rebuild-index --read-all-packs` or to manually delete the damaged index.\r\n\r\n    [#3488](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3488) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3591: Fix handling of `prune --max-repack-size=0`\r\n\r\n   Restic ignored the `--max-repack-size` option when passing a value of 0. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n   As a workaround, `--max-repack-size=1` can be used with older versions of restic.\r\n\r\n    [#3591](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3591) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3619: Avoid choosing parent snapshots newer than time of new snapshot\r\n\r\n   The `backup` command, when a `--parent` was not provided, previously chose the most recent matching snapshot as the parent snapshot. However, this didn't make sense when the user passed `--time` to create a new snapshot older than the most recent snapshot.\r\n\r\n   Instead, `backup` now chooses the most recent snapshot which is not newer than the snapshot-being-created's timestamp, to avoid any time travel.\r\n\r\n    [#3619](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3619) \r\n\r\n * Change #3641: Ignore parent snapshot for `backup --stdin`\r\n\r\n   Restic uses a parent snapshot to speed up directory scanning when performing backups, but this only wasted time and memory when the backup source is stdin (using the `--stdin` option of the `backup` command), since no directory scanning is performed in this case.\r\n\r\n   Snapshots made with `backup --stdin` no longer have a parent snapshot, which allows restic to skip some startup operations and saves a bit of resources.\r\n\r\n   The `--parent` option is still available for `backup --stdin`, but is now ignored.\r\n\r\n    [#3641](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3641) [#3645](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3645) \r\n\r\n * Change #3519: Require Go 1.14 or newer\r\n\r\n   Restic now requires Go 1.14 to build. This allows it to use new standard library features instead of an external dependency.\r\n\r\n    [#3519](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3519) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1542: Add `--dry-run`/`-n` option to `backup` command\r\n\r\n   Testing exclude filters and other configuration options was error prone as wrong filters could cause files to be uploaded unintentionally. It was also not possible to estimate beforehand how much data would be uploaded.\r\n\r\n   The `backup` command now has a `--dry-run`/`-n` option, which performs all the normal steps of a backup without actually writing anything to the repository.\r\n\r\n   Passing -vv will log information about files that would be added, allowing for verification of source and exclusion options before running the real backup.\r\n\r\n    [#1542](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1542) [#2308](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2308) [#3210](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3210) [#3300](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3300) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2202: Add upload checksum for Azure, GS, S3 and Swift backends\r\n\r\n   Previously only the B2 and partially the Swift backends verified the integrity of uploaded (encrypted) files. The verification works by informing the backend about the expected hash of the uploaded file. The backend then verifies the upload and thereby rules out any data corruption during upload.\r\n\r\n   We have now added upload checksums for the Azure, GS, S3 and Swift backends, which besides integrity checking for uploads also means that restic can now be used to store backups in S3 buckets which have Object Lock enabled.\r\n\r\n    [#2202](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2202) [#2700](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2700) [#3023](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3023) [#3246](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3246) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #233: Support negative include/exclude patterns\r\n\r\n   If a pattern starts with an exclamation mark and it matches a file that was previously matched by a regular pattern, the match is cancelled. Notably, this can be used with `--exclude-file` to cancel the exclusion of some files.\r\n\r\n   It works similarly to `.gitignore`, with the same limitation; Once a directory is excluded, it is not possible to include files inside the directory.\r\n\r\n   Example of use as an exclude pattern for the `backup` command:\r\n\r\n   $HOME/**/* !$HOME/Documents !$HOME/code !$HOME/.emacs.d !$HOME/games # [...] node_modules *~ *.o *.lo *.pyc # [...] $HOME/code/linux/* !$HOME/code/linux/.git # [...]\r\n\r\n    [#233](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/233) [#2311](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2311) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2388: Add warning for S3 if partial credentials are provided\r\n\r\n   Previously restic did not notify about incomplete credentials when using the S3 backend, instead just reporting access denied.\r\n\r\n   Restic now checks that both the AWS key ID and secret environment variables are set before connecting to the remote server, and reports an error if not.\r\n\r\n    [#2388](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2388) [#3532](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3532) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2508: Support JSON output and quiet mode for the `diff` command\r\n\r\n   The `diff` command now supports outputting machine-readable output in JSON format. To enable this, pass the `--json` option to the command. To only print the summary and suppress detailed output, pass the `--quiet` option.\r\n\r\n    [#2508](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2508) [#3592](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3592) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2656: Add flag to disable TLS verification for self-signed certificates\r\n\r\n   There is now an `--insecure-tls` global option in restic, which disables TLS verification for self-signed certificates in order to support some development workflows.\r\n\r\n    [#2656](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2656) [#2657](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2657) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3003: Atomic uploads for the SFTP backend\r\n\r\n   The SFTP backend did not upload files atomically. An interrupted upload could leave an incomplete file behind which could prevent restic from accessing the repository. This has now been fixed and uploads in the SFTP backend are done atomically.\r\n\r\n    [#3003](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3003) [#3524](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3524) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3127: Add xattr (extended attributes) support for Solaris\r\n\r\n   Restic now supports xattr for the Solaris operating system.\r\n\r\n    [#3127](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3127) [#3628](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3628) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3464: Skip lock creation on `forget` if `--no-lock` and `--dry-run`\r\n\r\n   Restic used to silently ignore the `--no-lock` option of the `forget` command.\r\n\r\n   It now skips creation of lock file in case both `--dry-run` and `--no-lock` are specified. If `--no-lock` option is specified without `--dry-run`, restic prints a warning message to stderr.\r\n\r\n    [#3464](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3464) [#3623](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3623) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3490: Support random subset by size in `check --read-data-subset`\r\n\r\n   The `--read-data-subset` option of the `check` command now supports a third way of specifying the subset to check, namely `nS` where `n` is a size in bytes with suffix `S` as k/K, m/M, g/G or t/T.\r\n\r\n    [#3490](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3490) [#3548](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3548) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3541: Improve handling of temporary B2 delete errors\r\n\r\n   Deleting files on B2 could sometimes fail temporarily, which required restic to retry the delete operation. In some cases the file was deleted nevertheless, causing the retries and ultimately the restic command to fail. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#3541](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3541) [#3544](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3544) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3542: Add file mode in symbolic notation to `ls --json`\r\n\r\n   The `ls --json` command now provides the file mode in symbolic notation (using the `permissions` key), aligned with `find --json`.\r\n\r\n    [#3542](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3542) [#3573](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3573) https://forum.restic.net/t/restic-ls-understanding-file-mode-with-json/4371\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2594: Speed up the `restore --verify` command\r\n\r\n   The `--verify` option lets the `restore` command verify the file content after it has restored a snapshot. The performance of this operation has now been improved by up to a factor of two.\r\n\r\n    [#2594](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2594) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2816: The `backup` command no longer updates file access times on Linux\r\n\r\n   When reading files during backup, restic used to cause the operating system to update the files' access times. Note that this did not apply to filesystems with disabled file access times.\r\n\r\n   Restic now instructs the operating system not to update the file access time, if the user running restic is the file owner or has root permissions.\r\n\r\n    [#2816](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2816) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2880: Make `recover` collect only unreferenced trees\r\n\r\n   Previously, the `recover` command used to generate a snapshot containing *all* root trees, even those which were already referenced by a snapshot.\r\n\r\n   This has been improved such that it now only processes trees not already referenced by any snapshot.\r\n\r\n    [#2880](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2880) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3429: Verify that new or modified keys are stored correctly\r\n\r\n   When adding a new key or changing the password of a key, restic used to just create the new key (and remove the old one, when changing the password). There was no verification that the new key was stored correctly and works properly. As the repository cannot be decrypted without a valid key file, this could in rare cases cause the repository to become inaccessible.\r\n\r\n   Restic now checks that new key files actually work before continuing. This can protect against some (rare) cases of hardware or storage problems.\r\n\r\n    [#3429](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3429) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3436: Improve local backend's resilience to (system) crashes\r\n\r\n   Restic now ensures that files stored using the `local` backend are created atomically (that is, files are either stored completely or not at all). This ensures that no incomplete files are left behind even if restic is terminated while writing a file.\r\n\r\n   In addition, restic now tries to ensure that the directory in the repository which contains a newly uploaded file is also written to disk. This can prevent missing files if the system crashes or the disk is not properly unmounted.\r\n\r\n    [#3436](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3436) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3508: Cache blobs read by the `dump` command\r\n\r\n   When dumping a file using the `dump` command, restic did not cache blobs in any way, so even consecutive runs of the same blob were loaded from the repository again and again, slowing down the dump.\r\n\r\n   Now, the caching mechanism already used by the `fuse` command is also used by the `dump` command. This makes dumping much faster, especially for sparse files.\r\n\r\n    [#3508](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3508) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3511: Support configurable timeout for the rclone backend\r\n\r\n   A slow rclone backend could cause restic to time out while waiting for the repository to open. Restic now offers an `-o rclone.timeout` option to make this timeout configurable.\r\n\r\n    [#3511](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3511) [#3514](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3514) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3593: Improve `copy` performance by parallelizing IO\r\n\r\n   Restic copy previously only used a single thread for copying blobs between repositories, which resulted in limited performance when copying small blobs to/from a high latency backend (i.e. any remote backend, especially b2).\r\n\r\n   Copying will now use 8 parallel threads to increase the throughput of the copy operation.\r\n\r\n    [#3593](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3593) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "We're very pleased to present you restic 0.12.1! restic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you already have restic >= 0.9.4, you can use `restic self-update` to get the latest version in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that in the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/developer_information.rst).\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.12.1 (2021-08-03)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.12.1 relevant to restic users.

This could cause for example the `check` command to report the following error:\r\n\r\n   Pack ID does not match, want [...], got e3b0c442\r\n\r\n   This has been fixed by correctly detecting and retrying the incomplete download.\r\n\r\n    [#2742](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2742) [#3453](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3453) https://forum.restic.net/t/http2-stream-closed-connection-reset-context-canceled/3743/10\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3111: Fix terminal output redirection for PowerShell\r\n\r\n   When redirecting the output of restic using PowerShell on Windows, the output contained terminal escape characters. This has been fixed by properly detecting the terminal type.\r\n\r\n   In addition, the mintty terminal now shows progress output for the backup command.\r\n\r\n    [#3111](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3111) [#3325](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3325) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3214: Treat an empty password as a fatal error for repository init\r\n\r\n   When attempting to initialize a new repository, if an empty password was supplied, the repository would be created but the init command would return an error with a stack trace. Now, if an empty password is provided, it is treated as a fatal error, and no repository is created.\r\n\r\n    [#3214](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3214) [#3283](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3283) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3267: `copy` failed to copy snapshots in rare cases\r\n\r\n   The `copy` command could in rare cases fail with the error message `SaveTree(...) returned unexpected id ...`.  This has been fixed.\r\n\r\n   On Linux/BSDs, the error could be caused by backing up symlinks with non-UTF-8 target paths. Note that, due to limitations in the repository format, these are not stored properly and should be avoided if possible.\r\n\r\n    [#3267](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3267) [#3310](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3310) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3184: `backup --quiet` no longer prints status information\r\n\r\n   A regression in the latest restic version caused the output of `backup --quiet` to contain large amounts of backup progress information when run using an interactive terminal. This is fixed now.\r\n\r\n   A workaround for this bug is to run restic as follows: `restic backup --quiet [..] | cat -`.\r\n\r\n    [#3184](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3184) [#3186](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3186) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3296: Fix crash of `check --read-data-subset=x%` run for an empty repository\r\n\r\n   The command `restic check --read-data-subset=x%` crashed when run for an empty repository. This has been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#3296](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3296) [#3309](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3309) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3302: Fix `fdopendir: not a directory` error for local backend\r\n\r\n   The `check`, `list packs`, `prune` and `rebuild-index` commands failed for the local backend when the `data` folder in the repository contained files. This has been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#3302](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3302) [#3308](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3308) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3334: Print `created new cache` message only on a terminal\r\n\r\n   The message `created new cache` was printed even when the output wasn't a terminal. That broke piping `restic dump` output to tar or zip if cache directory didn't exist. The message is now only printed on a terminal.\r\n\r\n    [#3334](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3334) [#3343](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3343) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3380: Fix crash of `backup --exclude='**'`\r\n\r\n   The exclude filter `**`, which excludes all files, caused restic to crash. This has been corrected.\r\n\r\n    [#3380](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3380) [#3393](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3393) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3305: Fix possibly missing backup summary of JSON output in case of error\r\n\r\n   When using `--json` output it happened from time to time that the summary output was missing in case an error occurred. This has been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#3305](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3305) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3439: Correctly handle download errors during `restore`\r\n\r\n   Due to a regression in restic 0.12.0, the `restore` command in some cases did not retry download errors and only printed a warning. This has been fixed by retrying incomplete data downloads.\r\n\r\n    [#3439](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3439) [#3449](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3449) \r\n\r\n * Change #3247: Empty files now have size of 0 in `ls --json` output\r\n\r\n   The `ls --json` command used to omit the sizes of empty files in its output. It now reports a size of zero explicitly for regular files, while omitting the size field for all other types.\r\n\r\n    [#3247](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3247) [#3257](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3257) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2780: Add release binaries for s390x architecture on Linux\r\n\r\n   We've added release binaries for Linux using the s390x architecture.\r\n\r\n    [#2780](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2780) [#3452](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3452) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3293: Add `--repository-file2` option to `init` and `copy` command\r\n\r\n   The `init` and `copy` command can now be used with the `--repository-file2` option or the `$RESTIC_REPOSITORY_FILE2` environment variable. These to options are in addition to the `--repo2` flag and allow you to read the destination repository from a file.\r\n\r\n   Using both `--repository-file` and `--repo2` options resulted in an error for the `copy` or `init` command. The handling of this combination of options has been fixed. A workaround for this issue is to only use `--repo` or `-r` and `--repo2` for `init` or `copy`.\r\n\r\n    [#3293](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3293) [#3294](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3294) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3312: Add auto-completion support for fish\r\n\r\n   The `generate` command now supports fish auto completion.\r\n\r\n    [#3312](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3312) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3336: SFTP backend now checks for disk space\r\n\r\n   Backing up over SFTP previously spewed multiple generic \"failure\" messages when the remote disk was full. It now checks for disk space before writing a file and fails immediately with a \"no space left on device\" message.\r\n\r\n    [#3336](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3336) [#3345](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3345) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3377: Add release binaries for Apple Silicon\r\n\r\n   We've added release binaries for macOS on Apple Silicon (M1).\r\n\r\n    [#3377](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3377) [#3394](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3394) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3414: Add `--keep-within-hourly` option to restic forget\r\n\r\n   The `forget` command allowed keeping a given number of hourly backups or to keep all backups within a given interval, but it was not possible to specify keeping hourly backups within a given interval.\r\n\r\n   The new `--keep-within-hourly` option now offers this functionality. Similar options for daily/weekly/monthly/yearly are also implemented, the new options are:\r\n\r\n   --keep-within-hourly <1y2m3d4h> --keep-within-daily <1y2m3d4h> --keep-within-weekly <1y2m3d4h> --keep-within-monthly <1y2m3d4h> --keep-within-yearly <1y2m3d4h>\r\n\r\n    [#3414](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3414) [#3416](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3416) https://forum.restic.net/t/forget-policy/4014/11\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3456: Support filtering and specifying untagged snapshots\r\n\r\n   It was previously not possible to specify an empty tag with the `--tag` and `--keep-tag` options. This has now been fixed, such that `--tag ''` and `--keep-tag ''` now matches snapshots without tags. This allows e.g. the `snapshots` and `forget` commands to only operate on untagged snapshots.\r\n\r\n    [#3456](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3456) [#3457](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3457) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3167: Allow specifying limit of `snapshots` list\r\n\r\n   The `--last` option allowed limiting the output of the `snapshots` command to the latest snapshot for each host. The new `--latest n` option allows limiting the output to the latest `n` snapshots.\r\n\r\n   This change deprecates the option `--last` in favour of `--latest 1`.\r\n\r\n    [#3167](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3167) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3426: Optimize read performance of mount command\r\n\r\n   Reading large files in a mounted repository may be up to five times faster. This improvement primarily applies to repositories stored at a backend that can be accessed with low latency, like e.g. the local backend.\r\n\r\n    [#3426](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3426) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3427: `find --pack` fallback to index if data file is missing\r\n\r\n   When investigating a repository with missing data files, it might be useful to determine affected snapshots before running `rebuild-index`. Previously, `find --pack pack-id` returned no data as it required accessing the data file. Now, if the necessary data is still available in the repository index, it gets retrieved from there.\r\n\r\n   The command now also supports looking up multiple pack files in a single `find` run.\r\n\r\n    [#3427](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3427) https://forum.restic.net/t/missing-packs-not-found/2600\r\n\r\n\r\n",

These errors are now ignored.\r\n\r\n    [#1800](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1800) [#3034](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3034) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2563: Report the correct owner of directories in FUSE mounts\r\n\r\n   Restic 0.10.0 changed the FUSE mount to always report the current user as the owner of directories within the FUSE mount, which is incorrect.\r\n\r\n   This is now changed back to reporting the correct owner of a directory.\r\n\r\n    [#2563](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2563) [#3141](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3141) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2688: Make `backup` and `tag` commands separate tags by comma\r\n\r\n   Running `restic backup --tag foo,bar` previously created snapshots with one single tag containing a comma (`foo,bar`) instead of two tags (`foo`, `bar`).\r\n\r\n   Similarly, the `tag` command's `--set`, `--add` and `--remove` options would treat `foo,bar` as one tag instead of two tags. This was inconsistent with other commands and often unexpected when one intended `foo,bar` to mean two tags.\r\n\r\n   To be consistent in all commands, restic now interprets `foo,bar` to mean two separate tags (`foo` and `bar`) instead of one tag (`foo,bar`) everywhere, including in the `backup` and `tag` commands.\r\n\r\n   NOTE: This change might result in unexpected behavior in cases where you use the `forget` command and filter on tags like `foo,bar`. Snapshots previously backed up with `--tag foo,bar` will still not match that filter, but snapshots saved from now on will match that filter.\r\n\r\n   To replace `foo,bar` tags with `foo` and `bar` tags in old snapshots, you can first generate a list of the relevant snapshots using a command like:\r\n\r\n   Restic snapshots --json --quiet | jq '.[] | select(contains({tags: [\"foo,bar\"]})) | .id'\r\n\r\n   And then use `restic tag --set foo --set bar snapshotID [...]` to set the new tags. Please adjust the commands to include real tag names and any additional tags, as well as the list of snapshots to process.\r\n\r\n    [#2688](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2688) [#2690](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2690) [#3197](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3197) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2739: Make the `cat` command respect the `--no-lock` option\r\n\r\n   The `cat` command would not respect the `--no-lock` flag. This is now fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#2739](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2739) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3087: The `--use-fs-snapshot` option now works on windows/386\r\n\r\n   Restic failed to create VSS snapshots on windows/386 with the following error:\r\n\r\n   GetSnapshotProperties() failed: E_INVALIDARG (0x80070057)\r\n\r\n   This is now fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#3087](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3087) [#3090](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3090) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3100: Do not require gs bucket permissions when running `init`\r\n\r\n   Restic used to require bucket level permissions for the `gs` backend in order to initialize a restic repository.\r\n\r\n   It now allows a `gs` service account to initialize a repository if the bucket does exist and the service account has permissions to write/read to that bucket.\r\n\r\n    [#3100](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3100) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3111: Correctly detect output redirection for `backup` command on Windows\r\n\r\n   On Windows, since restic 0.10.0 the `backup` command did not properly detect when the output was redirected to a file. This caused restic to output terminal control characters. This has been fixed by correcting the terminal detection.\r\n\r\n    [#3111](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3111) [#3150](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3150) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3151: Don't create invalid snapshots when `backup` is interrupted\r\n\r\n   When canceling a backup run at a certain moment it was possible that restic created a snapshot with an invalid \"null\" tree. This caused `check` and other operations to fail. The `backup` command now properly handles interruptions and never saves a snapshot when interrupted.\r\n\r\n    [#3151](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3151) [#3164](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3164) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3166: Improve error handling in the `restore` command\r\n\r\n   The `restore` command used to not print errors while downloading file contents from the repository. It also incorrectly exited with a zero error code even when there were errors during the restore process. This has all been fixed and `restore` now returns with a non-zero exit code when there's an error.\r\n\r\n    [#3166](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3166) [#3207](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3207) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3232: Correct statistics for overlapping targets\r\n\r\n   A user reported that restic's statistics and progress information during backup was not correctly calculated when the backup targets (files/dirs to save) overlap. For example, consider a directory `foo` which contains (among others) a file `foo/bar`. When `restic backup foo foo/bar` was run, restic counted the size of the file `foo/bar` twice, so the completeness percentage as well as the number of files was wrong. This is now corrected.\r\n\r\n    [#3232](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3232) [#3243](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3243) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3014: Fix sporadic stream reset between rclone and restic\r\n\r\n   Sometimes when using restic with the `rclone` backend, an error message similar to the following would be printed:\r\n\r\n   Didn't finish writing GET request (wrote 0/xxx): http2: stream closed\r\n\r\n   It was found that this was caused by restic closing the connection to rclone to soon when downloading data. A workaround has been added which waits for the end of the download before closing the connection.\r\n\r\n    [#2598](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2598) [#3014](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3014) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3152: Do not hang until foregrounded when completed in background\r\n\r\n   On Linux, when running in the background restic failed to stop the terminal output of the `backup` command after it had completed. This caused restic to hang until moved to the foreground. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#3152](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3152) https://forum.restic.net/t/restic-alpine-container-cron-hangs-epoll-pwait/3334\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #3249: Improve error handling in `gs` backend\r\n\r\n   The `gs` backend did not notice when the last step of completing a file upload failed. Under rare circumstances, this could cause missing files in the backup repository. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#3249](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3249) \r\n\r\n * Change #3095: Deleting files on Google Drive now moves them to the trash\r\n\r\n   When deleting files on Google Drive via the `rclone` backend, restic used to bypass the trash folder required that one used the `-o rclone.args` option to enable usage of the trash folder. This ensured that deleted files in Google Drive were not kept indefinitely in the trash folder. However, since Google Drive's trash retention policy changed to deleting trashed files after 30 days, this is no longer needed.\r\n\r\n   Restic now leaves it up to rclone and its configuration to use or not use the trash folder when deleting files. The default is to use the trash folder, as of rclone 1.53.2. To re-enable the restic 0.11 behavior, set the `RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH` environment variable or change the rclone configuration. See the rclone documentation for more details.\r\n\r\n    [#3095](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3095) [#3102](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3102) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2186: Allow specifying percentage in `check --read-data-subset`\r\n\r\n   We've enhanced the `check` command's `--read-data-subset` option to also accept a percentage (e.g. `2.5%` or `10%`). This will check the given percentage of pack files (which are randomly selected on each run).\r\n\r\n    [#2186](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2186) [#3038](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3038) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2453: Report permanent/fatal backend errors earlier\r\n\r\n   When encountering errors in reading from or writing to storage backends, restic retries the failing operation up to nine times (for a total of ten attempts). It used to retry all backend operations, but now detects some permanent error conditions so that it can report fatal errors earlier.\r\n\r\n   Permanent failures include local disks being full, SSH connections dropping and permission errors.\r\n\r\n    [#2453](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2453) [#3180](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3180) [#3170](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3170) [#3181](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3181) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2528: Add Alibaba/Aliyun OSS support in the `s3` backend\r\n\r\n   A new extended option `s3.bucket-lookup` has been added to support Alibaba/Aliyun OSS in the `s3` backend. The option can be set to one of the following values:\r\n\r\n   - `auto` - Existing behaviour - `dns` - Use DNS style bucket access - `path` - Use path style bucket access\r\n\r\n   To make the `s3` backend work with Alibaba/Aliyun OSS you must set `s3.bucket-lookup` to `dns` and set the `s3.region` parameter. For example:\r\n\r\n   Restic -o s3.bucket-lookup=dns -o s3.region=oss-eu-west-1 -r s3:https://oss-eu-west-1.aliyuncs.com/bucketname init\r\n\r\n   Note that `s3.region` must be set, otherwise the MinIO SDK tries to look it up and it seems that Alibaba doesn't support that properly.\r\n\r\n    [#2528](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2528) [#2535](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2535) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2706: Configurable progress reports for non-interactive terminals\r\n\r\n   The `backup`, `check` and `prune` commands never printed any progress reports on non-interactive terminals. This behavior is now configurable using the `RESTIC_PROGRESS_FPS` environment variable. Use for example a value of `1` for an update every second, or `0.01666` for an update every minute.\r\n\r\n   The `backup` command now also prints the current progress when restic receives a `SIGUSR1` signal.\r\n\r\n   Setting the `RESTIC_PROGRESS_FPS` environment variable or sending a `SIGUSR1` signal prints a status report even when `--quiet` was specified.\r\n\r\n    [#2706](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2706) [#3194](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3194) [#3199](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3199) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2944: Add `backup` options `--files-from-{verbatim,raw}`\r\n\r\n   The new `backup` options `--files-from-verbatim` and `--files-from-raw` read a list of files to back up from a file. Unlike the existing `--files-from` option, these options do not interpret the listed filenames as glob patterns; instead, whitespace in filenames is preserved as-is and no pattern expansion is done. Please see the documentation for specifics.\r\n\r\n   These new options are highly recommended over `--files-from`, when using a script to generate the list of files to back up.\r\n\r\n    [#2944](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2944) [#3013](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3013) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3083: Allow usage of deprecated S3 `ListObjects` API\r\n\r\n   Some S3 API implementations, e.g. Ceph before version 14.2.5, have a broken `ListObjectsV2` implementation which causes problems for restic when using their API endpoints. When a broken server implementation is used, restic prints errors similar to the following:\r\n\r\n   List() returned error: Truncated response should have continuation token set\r\n\r\n   As a temporary workaround, restic now allows using the older `ListObjects` endpoint by setting the `s3.list-objects-v1` extended option, for instance:\r\n\r\n   Restic -o s3.list-objects-v1=true snapshots\r\n\r\n   Please note that this option may be removed in future versions of restic.\r\n\r\n    [#3083](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3083) [#3085](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3085) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3147: Support additional environment variables for Swift authentication\r\n\r\n   The `swift` backend now supports the following additional environment variables for passing authentication details to restic: `OS_USER_ID`, `OS_USER_DOMAIN_ID`, `OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID` and `OS_TRUST_ID`\r\n\r\n   Depending on the `openrc` configuration file these might be required when the user and project domains differ from one another.\r\n\r\n    [#3147](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3147) [#3158](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3158) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3191: Add release binaries for MIPS architectures\r\n\r\n   We've added a few new architectures for Linux to the release binaries: `mips`, `mipsle`, `mips64`, and `mip64le`. MIPS is mostly used for low-end embedded systems.\r\n\r\n    [#3191](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/3191) [#3208](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3208) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #909: Back up mountpoints as empty directories\r\n\r\n   When the `--one-file-system` option is specified to `restic backup`, it ignores all file systems mounted below one of the target directories. This means that when a snapshot is restored, users needed to manually recreate the mountpoint directories.\r\n\r\n   Restic now backs up mountpoints as empty directories and therefore implements the same approach as `tar`.\r\n\r\n    [#909](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/909) [#3119](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3119) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3250: Add several more error checks\r\n\r\n   We've added a lot more error checks in places where errors were previously ignored (as hinted by the static analysis program `errcheck` via `golangci-lint`).\r\n\r\n    [#3250](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3250) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2718: Improve `prune` performance and make it more customizable\r\n\r\n   The `prune` command is now much faster. This is especially the case for remote repositories or repositories with not much data to remove. Also the memory usage of the `prune` command is now reduced.\r\n\r\n   Restic used to rebuild the index from scratch after pruning. This could lead to missing packs in the index in some cases for eventually consistent backends such as e.g. AWS S3. This behavior is now changed and the index rebuilding uses the information already known by `prune`.\r\n\r\n   By default, the `prune` command no longer removes all unused data. This behavior can be fine-tuned by new options, like the acceptable amount of unused space or the maximum size of data to reorganize. For more details, please see https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/060_forget.html .\r\n\r\n   Moreover, `prune` now accepts the `--dry-run` option and also running `forget --dry-run --prune` will show what `prune` would do.\r\n\r\n   This enhancement also fixes several open issues, e.g.: - https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1140 - https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1599 - https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1985 - https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2112 - https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2227 - https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2305\r\n\r\n    [#2718](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2718) [#2842](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2842) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2495: Add option to let `backup` trust mtime without checking ctime\r\n\r\n   The `backup` command used to require that both `ctime` and `mtime` of a file matched with a previously backed up version to determine that the file was unchanged. In other words, if either `ctime` or `mtime` of the file had changed, it would be considered changed and restic would read the file's content again to back up the relevant (changed) parts of it.\r\n\r\n   The new option `--ignore-ctime` makes restic look at `mtime` only, such that `ctime` changes for a file does not cause restic to read the file's contents again.\r\n\r\n   The check for both `ctime` and `mtime` was introduced in restic 0.9.6 to make backups more reliable in the face of programs that reset `mtime` (some Unix archivers do that), but it turned out to often be expensive because it made restic read file contents even if only the metadata (owner, permissions) of a file had changed. The new `--ignore-ctime` option lets the user restore the 0.9.5 behavior when needed. The existing `--ignore-inode` option already turned off this behavior, but also removed a different check.\r\n\r\n   Please note that changes in files' metadata are still recorded, regardless of the command line options provided to the backup command.\r\n\r\n    [#2495](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2495) [#2558](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2558) [#2819](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2819) [#2823](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2823) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2941: Speed up the repacking step of the `prune` command\r\n\r\n   The repack step of the `prune` command, which moves still used file parts into new pack files such that the old ones can be garbage collected later on, now processes multiple pack files in parallel. This is especially beneficial for high latency backends or when using a fast network connection.\r\n\r\n    [#2941](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2941) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3006: Speed up the `rebuild-index` command\r\n\r\n   We've optimized the `rebuild-index` command. Now, existing index entries are used to minimize the number of pack files that must be read. This speeds up the index rebuild a lot.\r\n\r\n   Additionally, the option `--read-all-packs` has been added, implementing the previous behavior.\r\n\r\n    [#3006](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3006) https://github.com/restic/restic/issue/2547\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3048: Add more checks for index and pack files in the `check` command\r\n\r\n   The `check` command run with the `--read-data` or `--read-data-subset` options used to only verify only the pack file content - it did not check if the blobs within the pack are correctly contained in the index.\r\n\r\n   A check for the latter is now in place, which can print the following error:\r\n\r\n   Blob ID is not contained in index or position is incorrect\r\n\r\n   Another test is also added, which compares pack file sizes computed from the index and the pack header with the actual file size. This test is able to detect truncated pack files.\r\n\r\n   If the index is not correct, it can be rebuilt by using the `rebuild-index` command.\r\n\r\n   Having added these tests, `restic check` is now able to detect non-existing blobs which are wrongly referenced in the index. This situation could have lead to missing data.\r\n\r\n    [#3048](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3048) [#3082](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3082) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2433: Make the `dump` command support `zip` format\r\n\r\n   Previously, restic could dump the contents of a whole folder structure only in the `tar` format. The `dump` command now has a new flag to change output format to `zip`. Just pass `--archive zip` as an option to `restic dump`.\r\n\r\n    [#2433](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2433) [#3081](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3081) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3099: Reduce memory usage of `check` command\r\n\r\n   The `check` command now requires less memory if it is run without the `--check-unused` option.\r\n\r\n    [#3099](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3099) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3106: Parallelize scan of snapshot content in `copy` and `prune`\r\n\r\n   The `copy` and `prune` commands used to traverse the directories of snapshots one by one to find used data. This snapshot traversal is now parallized which can speed up this step several times.\r\n\r\n   In addition the `check` command now reports how many snapshots have already been processed.\r\n\r\n    [#3106](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3106) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3130: Parallelize reading of locks and snapshots\r\n\r\n   Restic used to read snapshots sequentially. For repositories containing many snapshots this slowed down commands which have to read all snapshots.\r\n\r\n   Now the reading of snapshots is parallelized. This speeds up for example `prune`, `backup` and other commands that search for snapshots with certain properties or which have to find the `latest` snapshot.\r\n\r\n   The speed up also applies to locks stored in the backup repository.\r\n\r\n    [#3130](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3130) [#3174](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3174) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #3254: Enable HTTP/2 for backend connections\r\n\r\n   Go's HTTP library usually automatically chooses between HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2 depending on what the server supports. But for compatibility this mechanism is disabled if DialContext is used (which is the case for restic). This change allows restic's HTTP client to negotiate HTTP/2 if supported by the server.\r\n\r\n    [#3254](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3254) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "We're very pleased to present you restic 0.11.0! restic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you already have restic >= 0.9.4, you can use `restic self-update` to get the latest version in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that in the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/developer_information.rst).\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.11.0 (2020-11-05)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.11.0 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#1212](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1212): Restore timestamps and permissions on intermediate directories\r\n * Fix [#1756](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1756): Mark repository files as read-only when using the local backend\r\n * Fix [#2241](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2241): Hide password in REST backend repository URLs\r\n * Fix [#2319](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2319): Correctly dump directories into tar files\r\n * Fix [#2491](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2491): Don't require `self-update --output` placeholder file\r\n * Fix [#2834](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2834): Fix rare cases of backup command hanging forever\r\n * Fix [#2938](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2938): Fix manpage formatting\r\n * Fix [#2942](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2942): Make --exclude-larger-than handle disappearing files\r\n * Fix [#2951](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2951): Restic generate, help and self-update no longer check passwords\r\n * Fix [#2979](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2979): Make snapshots --json output [] instead of null when no snapshots\r\n * Enh [#2969](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2969): Optimize check for unchanged files during backup\r\n * Enh [#340](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/340): Add support for Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) on Windows\r\n * Enh [#2849](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2849): Authenticate to Google Cloud Storage with access token\r\n * Enh [#1458](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1458): New option --repository-file\r\n * Enh [#2978](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2978): Warn if parent snapshot cannot be loaded during backup\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1212: Restore timestamps and permissions on intermediate directories\r\n\r\n   When using the `--include` option of the restore command, restic restored timestamps and permissions only on directories selected by the include pattern. Intermediate directories, which are necessary to restore files located in sub- directories, were created with default permissions. We've fixed the restore command to restore timestamps and permissions for these directories as well.\r\n\r\n    [#1212](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1212) [#1402](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1402) [#2906](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2906) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1756: Mark repository files as read-only when using the local backend\r\n\r\n   Files stored in a local repository were marked as writeable on the filesystem for non-Windows systems, which did not prevent accidental file modifications outside of restic. In addition, the local backend did not work with certain filesystems and network mounts which do not permit modifications of file permissions.\r\n\r\n   Restic now marks files stored in a local repository as read-only on the filesystem on non-Windows systems. The error handling is improved to support more filesystems.\r\n\r\n    [#1756](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1756) [#2157](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2157) [#2989](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2989) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2241: Hide password in REST backend repository URLs\r\n\r\n   When using a password in the REST backend repository URL, the password could in some cases be included in the output from restic, e.g. when initializing a repo or during an error.\r\n\r\n   The password is now replaced with \"***\" where applicable.\r\n\r\n    [#2241](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2241) [#2658](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2658) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2319: Correctly dump directories into tar files\r\n\r\n   The dump command previously wrote directories in a tar file in a way which can cause compatibility problems. This caused, for example, 7zip on Windows to not open tar files containing directories. In addition it was not possible to dump directories with extended attributes. These compatibility problems are now corrected.\r\n\r\n   In addition, a tar file now includes the name of the owner and group of a file.\r\n\r\n    [#2319](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2319) [#3039](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/3039) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2491: Don't require `self-update --output` placeholder file\r\n\r\n   `restic self-update --output /path/to/new-restic` used to require that new-restic was an existing file, to be overwritten. Now it's possible to download an updated restic binary to a new path, without first having to create a placeholder file.\r\n\r\n    [#2491](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2491) [#2937](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2937) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2834: Fix rare cases of backup command hanging forever\r\n\r\n   We've fixed an issue with the backup progress reporting which could cause restic to hang forever right before finishing a backup.\r\n\r\n    [#2834](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2834) [#2963](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2963) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2938: Fix manpage formatting\r\n\r\n   The manpage formatting in restic v0.10.0 was garbled, which is fixed now.\r\n\r\n    [#2938](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2938) [#2977](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2977) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2942: Make --exclude-larger-than handle disappearing files\r\n\r\n   There was a small bug in the backup command's --exclude-larger-than option where files that disappeared between scanning and actually backing them up to the repository caused a panic. This is now fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#2942](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2942) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2951: Restic generate, help and self-update no longer check passwords\r\n\r\n   The commands `restic cache`, `generate`, `help` and `self-update` don't need passwords, but they previously did run the RESTIC_PASSWORD_COMMAND (if set in the environment), prompting users to authenticate for no reason. They now skip running the password command.\r\n\r\n    [#2951](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2951) [#2987](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2987) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2979: Make snapshots --json output [] instead of null when no snapshots\r\n\r\n   Restic previously output `null` instead of `[]` for the `--json snapshots` command, when there were no snapshots in the repository. This caused some minor problems when parsing the output, but is now fixed such that `[]` is output when the list of snapshots is empty.\r\n\r\n    [#2979](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2979) [#2984](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2984) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2969: Optimize check for unchanged files during backup\r\n\r\n   During a backup restic skips processing files which have not changed since the last backup run. Previously this required opening each file once which can be slow on network filesystems. The backup command now checks for file changes before opening a file. This considerably reduces the time to create a backup on network filesystems.\r\n\r\n    [#2969](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2969) [#2970](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2970) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #340: Add support for Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) on Windows\r\n\r\n   Volume Shadow Copy Service allows read access to files that are locked by another process using an exclusive lock through a filesystem snapshot. Restic was unable to backup those files before. This update enables backing up these files.\r\n\r\n   This needs to be enabled explicitely using the --use-fs-snapshot option of the backup command.\r\n\r\n    [#340](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/340) [#2274](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2274) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2849: Authenticate to Google Cloud Storage with access token\r\n\r\n   When using the GCS backend, it is now possible to authenticate with OAuth2 access tokens instead of a credentials file by setting the GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable.\r\n\r\n    [#2849](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2849) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1458: New option --repository-file\r\n\r\n   We've added a new command-line option --repository-file as an alternative to -r. This allows to read the repository URL from a file in order to prevent certain types of information leaks, especially for URLs containing credentials.\r\n\r\n    [#1458](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1458) [#2900](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2900) [#2910](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2910) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2978: Warn if parent snapshot cannot be loaded during backup\r\n\r\n   During a backup restic uses the parent snapshot to check whether a file was changed and has to be backed up again. For this check the backup has to read the directories contained in the old snapshot. If a tree blob cannot be loaded, restic now warns about this problem with the backup repository.\r\n\r\n    [#2978](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2978) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

number of processed directories instead of always zero.\r\n\r\n    [#1863](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1863) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2254: Fix tar issues when dumping `/`\r\n\r\n   We've fixed an issue with dumping either `/` or files on the first sublevel e.g. `/foo` to tar. This also fixes tar dumping issues on Windows where this issue could also happen.\r\n\r\n    [#2254](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2254) [#2357](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2357) [#2255](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2255) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2281: Handle format verbs like '%' properly in `find` output\r\n\r\n   The JSON or \"normal\" output of the `find` command can now deal with file names that contain substrings which the Golang `fmt` package considers \"format verbs\" like `%s`.\r\n\r\n    [#2281](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2281) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2298: Do not hang when run as a background job\r\n\r\n   Restic did hang on exit while restoring the terminal configuration when it was started as a background job, for example using `restic ... &`. This has been fixed by only restoring the terminal configuration when restic is interrupted while reading a password from the terminal.\r\n\r\n    [#2298](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2298) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2389: Fix mangled json output of backup command\r\n\r\n   We've fixed a race condition in the json output of the backup command that could cause multiple lines to get mixed up. We've also ensured that the backup summary is printed last.\r\n\r\n    [#2389](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2389) [#2545](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2545) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2390: Refresh lock timestamp\r\n\r\n   Long-running operations did not refresh lock timestamp, resulting in locks becoming stale. This is now fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#2390](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2390) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2429: Backup --json reports total_bytes_processed as 0\r\n\r\n   We've fixed the json output of total_bytes_processed. The non-json output was already fixed with pull request #2138 but left the json output untouched.\r\n\r\n    [#2429](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2429) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2469: Fix incorrect bytes stats in `diff` command\r\n\r\n   In some cases, the wrong number of bytes (e.g. 16777215.998 TiB) were reported by the `diff` command. This is now fixed.\r\n\r\n    [#2469](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2469) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2518: Do not crash with Synology NAS sftp server\r\n\r\n   It was found that when restic is used to store data on an sftp server on a Synology NAS with a relative path (one which does not start with a slash), it may go into an endless loop trying to create directories on the server. We've fixed this bug by using a function in the sftp library instead of our own implementation.\r\n\r\n   The bug was discovered because the Synology sftp server behaves erratic with non-absolute path (e.g. `home/restic-repo`). This can be resolved by just using an absolute path instead (`/home/restic-repo`). We've also added a paragraph in the FAQ.\r\n\r\n    [#2518](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2518) [#2363](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2363) [#2530](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2530) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2531: Fix incorrect size calculation in `stats --mode restore-size`\r\n\r\n   The restore-size mode of stats was counting hard-linked files as if they were independent.\r\n\r\n    [#2531](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2531) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2537: Fix incorrect file counts in `stats --mode restore-size`\r\n\r\n   The restore-size mode of stats was failing to count empty directories and some files with hard links.\r\n\r\n    [#2537](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2537) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2592: SFTP backend supports IPv6 addresses\r\n\r\n   The SFTP backend now supports IPv6 addresses natively, without relying on aliases in the external SSH configuration.\r\n\r\n    [#2592](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2592) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2607: Honor RESTIC_CACHE_DIR environment variable on Mac and Windows\r\n\r\n   On Mac and Windows, the RESTIC_CACHE_DIR environment variable was ignored. This variable can now be used on all platforms to set the directory where restic stores caches.\r\n\r\n    [#2607](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2607) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2668: Don't abort the stats command when data blobs are missing\r\n\r\n   Runing the stats command in the blobs-per-file mode on a repository with missing data blobs previously resulted in a crash.\r\n\r\n    [#2668](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2668) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2674: Add stricter prune error checks\r\n\r\n   Additional checks were added to the prune command in order to improve resiliency to backend, hardware and/or networking issues. The checks now detect a few more cases where such outside factors could potentially cause data loss.\r\n\r\n    [#2674](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2674) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2899: Fix possible crash in the progress bar of check --read-data\r\n\r\n   We've fixed a possible crash while displaying the progress bar for the check --read-data command. The crash occurred when the length of the progress bar status exceeded the terminal width, which only happened for very narrow terminal windows.\r\n\r\n    [#2899](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2899) https://forum.restic.net/t/restic-rclone-pcloud-connection-issues/2963/15\r\n\r\n * Change #2482: Remove vendored dependencies\r\n\r\n   We've removed the vendored dependencies (in the subdir `vendor/`). When building restic, the Go compiler automatically fetches the dependencies. It will also cryptographically verify that the correct code has been fetched by using the hashes in `go.sum` (see the link to the documentation below).\r\n\r\n    [#2482](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2482) https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_downloading_and_verification\r\n\r\n * Change #2546: Return exit code 3 when failing to backup all source data\r\n\r\n   The backup command used to return a zero exit code as long as a snapshot could be created successfully, even if some of the source files could not be read (in which case the snapshot would contain the rest of the files).\r\n\r\n   This made it hard for automation/scripts to detect failures/incomplete backups by looking at the exit code. Restic now returns the following exit codes for the backup command:\r\n\r\n   - 0 when the command was successful\r\n   - 1 when there was a fatal error (no snapshot created)\r\n   - 3 when some source data could not be read (incomplete snapshot created)\r\n\r\n    [#956](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/956) [#2064](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2064) [#2526](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2526) [#2364](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2364) [#2546](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2546) \r\n\r\n * Change #2600: Update dependencies, require Go >= 1.13\r\n\r\n   Restic now requires Go to be at least 1.13. This allows simplifications in the build process and removing workarounds.\r\n\r\n   This is also probably the last version of restic still supporting mounting repositories via fuse on macOS. The library we're using for fuse does not support macOS any more and osxfuse is not open source any more.\r\n\r\n    [#224](https://github.com/bazil/fuse/issues/224) [#590](https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/590) [#2600](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2600) [#2852](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2852) [#2927](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2927) \r\n\r\n * Change #1597: Honor the --no-lock flag in the mount command\r\n\r\n   The mount command now does not lock the repository if given the --no-lock flag. This allows to mount repositories which are archived on a read only backend/filesystem.\r\n\r\n    [#1597](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1597) [#2821](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2821) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1570: Support specifying multiple host flags for various commands\r\n\r\n   Previously commands didn't take more than one `--host` or `-H` argument into account, which could be limiting with e.g. the `forget` command.\r\n\r\n   The `dump`, `find`, `forget`, `ls`, `mount`, `restore`, `snapshots`, `stats` and `tag` commands will now take into account multiple `--host` and `-H` flags.\r\n\r\n    [#1570](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1570) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1680: Optimize `restic mount`\r\n\r\n   We've optimized the FUSE implementation used within restic. `restic mount` is now more responsive and uses less memory.\r\n\r\n    [#1680](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1680) [#2587](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2587) [#2787](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2787) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2072: Display snapshot date when using `restic find`\r\n\r\n   Added the respective snapshot date to the output of `restic find`.\r\n\r\n    [#2072](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2072) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2175: Allow specifying user and host when creating keys\r\n\r\n   When adding a new key to the repository, the username and hostname for the new key can be specified on the command line. This allows overriding the defaults, for example if you would prefer to use the FQDN to identify the host or if you want to add keys for several different hosts without having to run the key add command on those hosts.\r\n\r\n    [#2175](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2175) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2277: Add support for ppc64le\r\n\r\n   Adds support for ppc64le, the processor architecture from IBM.\r\n\r\n    [#2277](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2277) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2395: Ignore sync errors when operation not supported by local filesystem\r\n\r\n   The local backend has been modified to work with filesystems which doesn't support the `sync` operation. This operation is normally used by restic to ensure that data files are fully written to disk before continuing.\r\n\r\n   For these limited filesystems, saving a file in the backend would previously fail with an \"operation not supported\" error. This error is now ignored, which means that e.g. an SMB mount on macOS can now be used as storage location for a repository.\r\n\r\n    [#2395](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2395) https://forum.restic.net/t/sync-errors-on-mac-over-smb/1859\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2427: Add flag `--iexclude-file` to backup command\r\n\r\n   The backup command now supports the flag `--iexclude-file` which is a case-insensitive version of `--exclude-file`.\r\n\r\n    [#2427](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2427) [#2898](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2898) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2569: Support excluding files by their size\r\n\r\n   The `backup` command now supports the `--exclude-larger-than` option to exclude files which are larger than the specified maximum size. This can for example be useful to exclude unimportant files with a large file size.\r\n\r\n    [#2569](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2569) [#2914](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2914) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2571: Self-heal missing file parts during backup of unchanged files\r\n\r\n   We've improved the resilience of restic to certain types of repository corruption.\r\n\r\n   For files that are unchanged since the parent snapshot, the backup command now verifies that all parts of the files still exist in the repository. Parts that are missing, e.g. from a damaged repository, are backed up again. This verification was already run for files that were modified since the parent snapshot, but is now also done for unchanged files.\r\n\r\n   Note that restic will not backup file parts that are referenced in the index but where the actual data is not present on disk, as this situation can only be detected by restic check. Please ensure that you run `restic check` regularly.\r\n\r\n    [#2571](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2571) [#2827](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2827) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2858: Support filtering snapshots by tag and path in the stats command\r\n\r\n   We've added filtering snapshots by `--tag tagList` and by `--path path` to the `stats` command. This includes filtering of only 'latest' snapshots or all snapshots in a repository.\r\n\r\n    [#2858](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2858) [#2859](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2859) https://forum.restic.net/t/stats-for-a-host-and-filtered-snapshots/3020\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #323: Add command for copying snapshots between repositories\r\n\r\n   We've added a copy command, allowing you to copy snapshots from one repository to another.\r\n\r\n   Note that this process will have to read (download) and write (upload) the entire snapshot(s) due to the different encryption keys used on the source and destination repository. Also, the transferred files are not re-chunked, which may break deduplication between files already stored in the destination repo and files copied there using this command.\r\n\r\n   To fully support deduplication between repositories when the copy command is used, the init command now supports the `--copy-chunker-params` option, which initializes the new repository with identical parameters for splitting files into chunks as an already existing repository. This allows copied snapshots to be equally deduplicated in both repositories.\r\n\r\n    [#323](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/323) [#2606](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2606) [#2928](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2928) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #551: Use optimized library for hash calculation of file chunks\r\n\r\n   We've switched the library used to calculate the hashes of file chunks, which are used for deduplication, to the optimized Minio SHA-256 implementation.\r\n\r\n   Depending on the CPU it improves the hashing throughput by 10-30%. Modern x86 CPUs with the SHA Extension should be about two to three times faster.\r\n\r\n    [#551](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/551) [#2709](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2709) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2195: Simplify and improve restore performance\r\n\r\n   Significantly improves restore performance of large files (i.e. 50M+): https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2074 https://forum.restic.net/t/restore-using-rclone-gdrive-backend-is-slow/1112/8 https://forum.restic.net/t/degraded-restore-performance-s3-backend/1400\r\n\r\n   Fixes \"not enough cache capacity\" error during restore: https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2244\r\n\r\n   NOTE: This new implementation does not guarantee order in which blobs are written to the target files and, for example, the last blob of a file can be written to the file before any of the preceeding file blobs. It is therefore possible to have gaps in the data written to the target files if restore fails or interrupted by the user.\r\n\r\n   The implementation will try to preallocate space for the restored files on the filesystem to prevent file fragmentation. This ensures good read performance for large files, like for example VM images. If preallocating space is not supported by the filesystem, then this step is silently skipped.\r\n\r\n    [#2195](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2195) [#2893](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2893) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2328: Improve speed of check command\r\n\r\n   We've improved the check command to traverse trees only once independent of whether they are contained in multiple snapshots. The check command is now much faster for repositories with a large number of snapshots.\r\n\r\n    [#2284](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2284) [#2328](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2328) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2423: Support user@domain parsing as user\r\n\r\n   Added the ability for user@domain-like users to be authenticated over SFTP servers.\r\n\r\n    [#2423](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2423) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2576: Improve the chunking algorithm\r\n\r\n   We've updated the chunker library responsible for splitting files into smaller blocks. It should improve the chunking throughput by 5-15% depending on the CPU.\r\n\r\n    [#2820](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2820) [#2576](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2576) [#2845](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2845) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2598: Improve speed of diff command\r\n\r\n   We've improved the performance of the diff command when comparing snapshots with similar content. It should run up to twice as fast as before.\r\n\r\n    [#2598](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2598) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2599: Slightly reduce memory usage of prune and stats commands\r\n\r\n   The prune and the stats command kept directory identifiers in memory twice while searching for used blobs.\r\n\r\n    [#2599](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2599) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2733: S3 backend: Add support for WebIdentityTokenFile\r\n\r\n   We've added support for EKS IAM roles for service accounts feature to the S3 backend.\r\n\r\n    [#2703](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2703) [#2733](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2733) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2773: Optimize handling of new index entries\r\n\r\n   Restic now uses less memory for backups which add a lot of data, e.g. large initial backups. In addition, we've improved the stability in some edge cases.\r\n\r\n    [#2773](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2773) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2781: Reduce memory consumption of in-memory index\r\n\r\n   We've improved how the index is stored in memory. This change can reduce memory usage for large repositories by up to 50% (depending on the operation).\r\n\r\n    [#2781](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2781) [#2812](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2812) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2786: Optimize `list blobs` command\r\n\r\n   We've changed the implementation of `list blobs` which should be now a bit faster and consume almost no memory even for large repositories.\r\n\r\n    [#2786](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2786) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2790: Optimized file access in restic mount\r\n\r\n   Reading large (> 100GiB) files from restic mountpoints is now faster, and the speedup is greater for larger files.\r\n\r\n    [#2790](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2790) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2840: Speed-up file deletion in forget, prune and rebuild-index\r\n\r\n   We've sped up the file deletion for the commands forget, prune and rebuild-index, especially for remote repositories. Deletion was sequential before and is now run in parallel.\r\n\r\n    [#2840](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2840) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "We're very pleased to present you restic 0.9.6! restic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you already have restic >= 0.9.3, you can use `restic self-update` to get the latest version in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can easily reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that in the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/developer_information.rst).\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.9.6 (2019-11-22)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.9.6 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#2063](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2063): Allow absolute path for filename when backing up from stdin\r\n * Fix [#2174](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2174): Save files with invalid timestamps\r\n * Fix [#2249](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2249): Read fresh metadata for unmodified files\r\n * Fix [#2301](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2301): Add upper bound for t in --read-data-subset=n/t\r\n * Fix [#2321](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2321): Check errors when loading index files\r\n * Enh [#2179](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2179): Use ctime when checking for file changes\r\n * Enh [#2306](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2306): Allow multiple retries for interactive password input\r\n * Enh [#2330](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2330): Make `--group-by` accept both singular and plural\r\n * Enh [#2350](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2350): Add option to configure S3 region\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2063: Allow absolute path for filename when backing up from stdin\r\n\r\n   When backing up from stdin, handle directory path for `--stdin-filename`. This can be used to specify the full path for the backed-up file.\r\n\r\n    [#2063](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2063) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2174: Save files with invalid timestamps\r\n\r\n   When restic reads invalid timestamps (year is before 0000 or after 9999) it refused to read and archive the file. We've changed the behavior and will now save modified timestamps with the year set to either 0000 or 9999, the rest of the timestamp stays the same, so the file will be saved (albeit with a bogus timestamp).\r\n\r\n    [#2174](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2174) [#1173](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1173) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2249: Read fresh metadata for unmodified files\r\n\r\n   Restic took all metadata for files which were detected as unmodified, not taking into account changed metadata (ownership, mode). This is now corrected.\r\n\r\n    [#2249](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2249) [#2252](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2252) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2301: Add upper bound for t in --read-data-subset=n/t\r\n\r\n   256 is the effective maximum for t, but restic would allow larger values, leading to strange behavior.\r\n\r\n    [#2301](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2301) [#2304](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2304) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2321: Check errors when loading index files\r\n\r\n   Restic now checks and handles errors which occur when loading index files, the missing check leads to odd errors (and a stack trace printed to users) later. This was reported in the forum.\r\n\r\n    [#2321](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2321) https://forum.restic.net/t/check-rebuild-index-prune/1848/13\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2179: Use ctime when checking for file changes\r\n\r\n   Previously, restic only checked a file's mtime (along with other non-timestamp metadata) to decide if a file has changed. This could cause restic to not notice that a file has changed (and therefore continue to store the old version, as opposed to the modified version) if something edits the file and then resets the timestamp. Restic now also checks the ctime of files, so any modifications to a file should be noticed, and the modified file will be backed up. The ctime check will be disabled if the --ignore-inode flag was given.\r\n\r\n   If this change causes problems for you, please open an issue, and we can look in to adding a seperate flag to disable just the ctime check.\r\n\r\n    [#2179](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2179) [#2212](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2212) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2306: Allow multiple retries for interactive password input\r\n\r\n   Restic used to quit if the repository password was typed incorrectly once. Restic will now ask the user again for the repository password if typed incorrectly. The user will now get three tries to input the correct password before restic quits.\r\n\r\n    [#2306](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2306) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2330: Make `--group-by` accept both singular and plural\r\n\r\n   One can now use the values `host`/`hosts`, `path`/`paths` and `tag` / `tags` interchangeably in the `--group-by` argument.\r\n\r\n    [#2330](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2330) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2350: Add option to configure S3 region\r\n\r\n   We've added a new option for setting the region when accessing an S3-compatible service. For some providers, it is required to set this to a valid value. You can do that either by setting the environment variable `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` or using the option `s3.region`, e.g. like this: `-o s3.region=\"us-east-1\"`.\r\n\r\n    [#2350](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2350) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "We're very pleased to present you restic 0.9.5! restic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you already have restic >= 0.9.3, you can use `restic self-update` to get the latest version in a secure way.\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can easily reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that in the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/developer_information.rst).\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.9.5 (2019-04-23)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.9.5 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#2135](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2135): Return error when no bytes could be read from stdin\r\n * Fix [#2181](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2181): Don't cancel timeout after 30 seconds for self-update\r\n * Fix [#2203](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2203): Fix reading passwords from stdin\r\n * Fix [#2224](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2224): Don't abort the find command when a tree can't be loaded\r\n * Enh [#1895](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1895): Add case insensitive include & exclude options\r\n * Enh [#1937](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1937): Support streaming JSON output for backup\r\n * Enh [#2155](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2155): Add Openstack application credential auth for Swift\r\n * Enh [#2184](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2184): Add --json support to forget command\r\n * Enh [#2037](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2037): Add group-by option to snapshots command\r\n * Enh [#2124](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2124): Ability to dump folders to tar via stdout\r\n * Enh [#2139](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2139): Return error if no bytes could be read for `backup --stdin`\r\n * Enh [#2205](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2205): Add --ignore-inode option to backup cmd\r\n * Enh [#2220](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2220): Add config option to set S3 storage class\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2135: Return error when no bytes could be read from stdin\r\n\r\n   We assume that users reading backup data from stdin want to know when no data could be read, so now restic returns an error when `backup --stdin` is called but no bytes could be read. Usually, this means that an earlier command in a pipe has failed. The documentation was amended and now recommends setting the `pipefail` option (`set -o pipefail`).\r\n\r\n    [#2135](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2135) [#2139](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2139) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2181: Don't cancel timeout after 30 seconds for self-update\r\n\r\n    [#2181](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2181) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2203: Fix reading passwords from stdin\r\n\r\n   Passwords for the `init`, `key add`, and `key passwd` commands can now be read from non-terminal stdin.\r\n\r\n    [#2203](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2203) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2224: Don't abort the find command when a tree can't be loaded\r\n\r\n   Change the find command so that missing trees don't result in a crash. Instead, the error is logged to the debug log, and the tree ID is displayed along with the snapshot it belongs to.  This makes it possible to recover repositories that are missing trees by forgetting the snapshots they are used in.\r\n\r\n    [#2224](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2224) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1895: Add case insensitive include & exclude options\r\n\r\n   The backup and restore commands now have --iexclude and --iinclude flags as case insensitive variants of --exclude and --include.\r\n\r\n    [#1895](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1895) [#2032](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2032) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1937: Support streaming JSON output for backup\r\n\r\n   We've added support for getting machine-readable status output during backup, just pass the flag `--json` for `restic backup` and restic will output a stream of JSON objects which contain the current progress.\r\n\r\n    [#1937](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1937) [#1944](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1944) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2155: Add Openstack application credential auth for Swift\r\n\r\n   Since Openstack Queens Identity (auth V3) service supports an application credential auth method.  It allows to create a technical account with the limited roles. This commit adds an application credential authentication method for the Swift backend.\r\n\r\n    [#2155](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2155) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2184: Add --json support to forget command\r\n\r\n   The forget command now supports the --json argument, outputting the information about what is (or would-be) kept and removed from the repository.\r\n\r\n    [#2184](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2184) [#2185](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2185) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2037: Add group-by option to snapshots command\r\n\r\n   We have added an option to group the output of the snapshots command, similar to the output of the forget command. The option has been called \"--group-by\" and accepts any combination of the values \"host\", \"paths\" and \"tags\", separated by commas. Default behavior (not specifying --group-by) has not been changed. We have added support of the grouping to the JSON output.\r\n\r\n    [#2037](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2037) [#2087](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2087) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2124: Ability to dump folders to tar via stdout\r\n\r\n   We've added the ability to dump whole folders to stdout via the `dump` command. Restic now requires at least Go 1.10 due to a limitation of the standard library for Go <= 1.9.\r\n\r\n    [#2123](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2123) [#2124](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2124) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2139: Return error if no bytes could be read for `backup --stdin`\r\n\r\n   When restic is used to backup the output of a program, like `mysqldump | restic backup --stdin`, it now returns an error if no bytes could be read at all. This catches the failure case when `mysqldump` failed for some reason and did not output any data to stdout.\r\n\r\n    [#2139](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2139) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2205: Add --ignore-inode option to backup cmd\r\n\r\n   This option handles backup of virtual filesystems that do not keep fixed inodes for files, like Fuse-based, pCloud, etc. Ignoring inode changes allows to consider the file as unchanged if last modification date and size are unchanged.\r\n\r\n    [#1631](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1631) [#2205](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2205) [#2047](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2047) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2220: Add config option to set S3 storage class\r\n\r\n   The `s3.storage-class` option can be passed to restic (using `-o`) to specify the storage class to be used for S3 objects created by restic.\r\n\r\n   The storage class is passed as-is to S3, so it needs to be understood by the API. On AWS, it can be one of `STANDARD`, `STANDARD_IA`, `ONEZONE_IA`, `INTELLIGENT_TIERING` and `REDUCED_REDUNDANCY`. If unspecified, the default storage class is used (`STANDARD` on AWS).\r\n\r\n   You can mix storage classes in the same bucket, and the setting isn't stored in the restic repository, so be sure to specify it with each command that writes to S3.\r\n\r\n    [#706](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/706) [#2220](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2220) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#1989](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1989): Google Cloud Storage: Respect bandwidth limit\r\n * Fix [#2040](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2040): Add host name filter shorthand flag for `stats` command\r\n * Fix [#2068](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2068): Correctly return error loading data\r\n * Fix [#2095](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2095): Consistently use local time for snapshots times\r\n * Enh [#1605](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1605): Concurrent restore\r\n * Enh [#2089](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2089): Increase granularity of the \"keep within\" retention policy\r\n * Enh [#2097](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2097): Add key hinting\r\n * Enh [#2017](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2017): Mount: Enforce FUSE Unix permissions with allow-other\r\n * Enh [#2070](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2070): Make all commands display timestamps in local time\r\n * Enh [#2085](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2085): Allow --files-from to be specified multiple times\r\n * Enh [#2094](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2094): Run command to get password\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1989: Google Cloud Storage: Respect bandwidth limit\r\n\r\n   The GCS backend did not respect the bandwidth limit configured, a previous commit accidentally removed support for it.\r\n\r\n    [#1989](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1989) [#2100](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2100) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2040: Add host name filter shorthand flag for `stats` command\r\n\r\n   The default value for `--host` flag was set to 'H' (the shorthand version of the flag), this caused the lookup for the latest snapshot to fail.\r\n\r\n   Add shorthand flag `-H` for `--host` (with empty default so if these flags are not specified the latest snapshot will not filter by host name).\r\n\r\n   Also add shorthand `-H` for `backup` command.\r\n\r\n    [#2040](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2040) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2068: Correctly return error loading data\r\n\r\n   In one case during `prune` and `check`, an error loading data from the backend is not returned properly. This is now corrected.\r\n\r\n    [#1999](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1999) [#2068](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2068) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #2095: Consistently use local time for snapshots times\r\n\r\n   By default snapshots created with restic backup were set to local time, but when the --time flag was used the provided timestamp was parsed as UTC. With this change all snapshots times are set to local time.\r\n\r\n    [#2095](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2095) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1605: Concurrent restore\r\n\r\n   This change significantly improves restore performance, especially when using high-latency remote repositories like B2.\r\n\r\n   The implementation now uses several concurrent threads to download and process multiple remote files concurrently. To further reduce restore time, each remote file is downloaded using a single repository request.\r\n\r\n    [#1605](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1605) [#1719](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1719) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2089: Increase granularity of the \"keep within\" retention policy\r\n\r\n   The `keep-within` option of the `forget` command now accepts time ranges with an hourly granularity. For example, running `restic forget --keep-within 3d12h` will keep all the snapshots made within three days and twelve hours from the time of the latest snapshot.\r\n\r\n    [#2089](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2089) [#2090](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2090) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2097: Add key hinting\r\n\r\n   Added a new option `--key-hint` and corresponding environment variable `RESTIC_KEY_HINT`.  The key hint is a key ID to try decrypting first, before other keys in the repository.\r\n\r\n   This change will benefit repositories with many keys; if the correct key hint is supplied then restic only needs to check one key.  If the key hint is incorrect (the key does not exist, or the password is incorrect) then restic will check all keys, as usual.\r\n\r\n    [#2097](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2097) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2017: Mount: Enforce FUSE Unix permissions with allow-other\r\n\r\n   The fuse mount (`restic mount`) now lets the kernel check the permissions of the files within snapshots (this is done through the `DefaultPermissions` FUSE option) when the option `--allow-other` is specified.\r\n\r\n   To restore the old behavior, we've added the `--no-default-permissions` option. This allows all users that have access to the mount point to access all files within the snapshots.\r\n\r\n    [#2017](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2017) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2070: Make all commands display timestamps in local time\r\n\r\n   Restic used to drop the timezone information from displayed timestamps, it now converts timestamps to local time before printing them so the times can be easily compared to.\r\n\r\n    [#2070](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2070) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2085: Allow --files-from to be specified multiple times\r\n\r\n   Before, restic took only the last file specified with `--files-from` into account, this is now corrected.\r\n\r\n    [#2085](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2085) [#2086](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2086) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2094: Run command to get password\r\n\r\n   We've added the `--password-command` option which allows specifying a command that restic runs every time the password for the repository is needed, so it can be integrated with a password manager or keyring. The option can also be set via the environment variable `$RESTIC_PASSWORD_COMMAND`.\r\n\r\n    [#2094](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2094) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "We're very pleased to announce restic 0.9.3! restic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net).\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can easily reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that in the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/developer_information.rst).\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.9.3 (2018-10-13)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.9.3 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#1935](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1935): Remove truncated files from cache\r\n * Fix [#1978](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1978): Do not return an error when the scanner is faster than backup\r\n * Enh [#1766](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1766): Restore: suppress lchown errors when not running as root\r\n * Enh [#1909](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1909): Reject files/dirs by name first\r\n * Enh [#1940](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1940): Add directory filter to ls command\r\n * Enh [#1967](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1967): Use `--host` everywhere\r\n * Enh [#2028](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2028): Display size of cache directories\r\n * Enh [#1777](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1777): Improve the `find` command\r\n * Enh [#1876](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1876): Display reason why forget keeps snapshots\r\n * Enh [#1891](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1891): Accept glob in paths loaded via --files-from\r\n * Enh [#1920](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1920): Vendor dependencies with Go 1.11 Modules\r\n * Enh [#1949](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1949): Add new command `self-update`\r\n * Enh [#1953](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1953): Ls: Add JSON output support for restic ls cmd\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1935: Remove truncated files from cache\r\n\r\n   When a file in the local cache is truncated, and restic tries to access data beyond the end of the (cached) file, it used to return an error \"EOF\". This is now fixed, such truncated files are removed and the data is fetched directly from the backend.\r\n\r\n    [#1935](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1935) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1978: Do not return an error when the scanner is faster than backup\r\n\r\n   When restic makes a backup, there's a background task called \"scanner\" which collects information on how many files and directories are to be saved, in order to display progress information to the user. When the backup finishes faster than the scanner, it is aborted because the result is not needed any more. This logic contained a bug, where quitting the scanner process was treated as an error, and caused restic to print an unhelpful error message (\"context canceled\").\r\n\r\n    [#1978](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1978) [#1991](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1991) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1766: Restore: suppress lchown errors when not running as root\r\n\r\n   Like \"cp\" and \"rsync\" do, restic now only reports errors for changing the ownership of files during restore if it is run ￼as root, on non-Windows operating systems. On Windows, the error is reported as usual.\r\n\r\n    [#1766](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1766) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1909: Reject files/dirs by name first\r\n\r\n   The current scanner/archiver code had an architectural limitation: it always ran the `lstat()` system call on all files and directories before a decision to include/exclude the file/dir was made. This lead to a lot of unnecessary system calls for items that could have been rejected by their name or path only.\r\n\r\n   We've changed the archiver/scanner implementation so that it now first rejects by name/path, and only runs the system call on the remaining items. This reduces the number of `lstat()` system calls a lot (depending on the exclude settings).\r\n\r\n    [#1909](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1909) [#1912](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1912) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1940: Add directory filter to ls command\r\n\r\n   The ls command can now be filtered by directories, so that only files in the given directories will be shown. If the --recursive flag is specified, then ls will traverse subfolders and list their files as well.\r\n\r\n   It used to be possible to specify multiple snapshots, but that has been replaced by only one snapshot and the possibility of specifying multiple directories.\r\n\r\n   Specifying directories constrains the walk, which can significantly speed up the listing.\r\n\r\n    [#1940](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1940) [#1941](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1941) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1967: Use `--host` everywhere\r\n\r\n   We now use the flag `--host` for all commands which need a host name, using `--hostname` (e.g. for `restic backup`) still works, but will print a deprecation warning. Also, add the short option `-H` where possible.\r\n\r\n    [#1967](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1967) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #2028: Display size of cache directories\r\n\r\n   The `cache` command now by default shows the size of the individual cache directories. It can be disabled with `--no-size`.\r\n\r\n    [#2028](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2028) [#2033](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/2033) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1777: Improve the `find` command\r\n\r\n   We've updated the `find` command to support multiple patterns.\r\n\r\n   `restic find` is now able to list the snapshots containing a specific tree or blob, or even the snapshots that contain blobs belonging to a given pack. A list of IDs can be given, as long as they all have the same type.\r\n\r\n   The command `find` can also display the pack IDs the blobs belong to, if the `--show-pack-id` flag is provided.\r\n\r\n    [#1777](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1777) [#1780](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1780) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1876: Display reason why forget keeps snapshots\r\n\r\n   We've added a column to the list of snapshots `forget` keeps which details the reasons to keep a particuliar snapshot. This makes debugging policies for forget much easier. Please remember to always try things out with `--dry-run`!\r\n\r\n    [#1876](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1876) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1891: Accept glob in paths loaded via --files-from\r\n\r\n   Before that, behaviour was different if paths were appended to command line or from a file, because wild card characters were expanded by shell if appended to command line, but not expanded if loaded from file.\r\n\r\n    [#1891](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1891) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1920: Vendor dependencies with Go 1.11 Modules\r\n\r\n   Until now, we've used `dep` for managing dependencies, we've now switch to using Go modules. For users this does not change much, only if you want to compile restic without downloading anything with Go 1.11, then you need to run: `go build -mod=vendor build.go`\r\n\r\n    [#1920](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1920) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1949: Add new command `self-update`\r\n\r\n   We have added a new command called `self-update` which downloads the latest released version of restic from GitHub and replaces the current binary with it. It does not rely on any external program (so it'll work everywhere), but still verifies the GPG signature using the embedded GPG public key.\r\n\r\n   By default, the `self-update` command is hidden behind the `selfupdate` built tag, which is only set when restic is built using `build.go` (including official releases). The reason for this is that downstream distributions will then not include the command by default, so users are encouraged to use the platform-specific distribution mechanism.\r\n\r\n    [#1949](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1949) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1953: Ls: Add JSON output support for restic ls cmd\r\n\r\n   We've implemented listing files in the repository with JSON as output, just pass `--json` as an option to `restic ls`. This makes the output of the command machine readable.\r\n\r\n    [#1953](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1953) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "We're very pleased to announce restic 0.9.2! restic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net).\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can easily reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that are contained in the [builder repository](https://github.com/restic/builder).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.9.2 (2018-08-06)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.9.2 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#1854](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1854): Allow saving files/dirs on different fs with `--one-file-system`\r\n * Fix [#1870](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1870): Fix restore with --include\r\n * Fix [#1880](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1880): Use `--cache-dir` argument for `check` command\r\n * Fix [#1893](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1893): Return error when exclude file cannot be read\r\n * Fix [#1861](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1861): Fix case-insensitive search with restic find\r\n * Enh [#1906](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1906): Add support for B2 application keys\r\n * Enh [#874](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/874): Add stats command to get information about a repository\r\n * Enh [#1772](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1772): Add restore --verify to verify restored file content\r\n * Enh [#1853](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1853): Add JSON output support to `restic key list`\r\n * Enh [#1477](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1477): S3 backend: accept AWS_SESSION_TOKEN\r\n * Enh [#1901](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1901): Update the Backblaze B2 library\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1854: Allow saving files/dirs on different fs with `--one-file-system`\r\n\r\n   Restic now allows saving files/dirs on a different file system in a subdir correctly even when `--one-file-system` is specified.\r\n\r\n   The first thing the restic archiver code does is to build a tree of the target files/directories. If it detects that a parent directory is already included (e.g. `restic backup /foo /foo/bar/baz`), it'll ignore the latter argument.\r\n\r\n   Without `--one-file-system`, that's perfectly valid: If `/foo` is to be archived, it will include `/foo/bar/baz`. But with `--one-file-system`, `/foo/bar/baz` may reside on a different file system, so it won't be included with `/foo`.\r\n\r\n    [#1854](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1854) [#1855](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1855) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1870: Fix restore with --include\r\n\r\n   We fixed a bug which prevented restic to restore files with an include filter.\r\n\r\n    [#1870](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1870) [#1900](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1900) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1880: Use `--cache-dir` argument for `check` command\r\n\r\n   `check` command now uses a temporary sub-directory of the specified directory if set using the `--cache-dir` argument. If not set, the cache directory is created in the default temporary directory as before. In either case a temporary cache is used to ensure the actual repository is checked (rather than a local copy).\r\n\r\n   The `--cache-dir` argument was not used by the `check` command, instead a cache directory was created in the temporary directory.\r\n\r\n    [#1880](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1880) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1893: Return error when exclude file cannot be read\r\n\r\n   A bug was found: when multiple exclude files were passed to restic and one of them could not be read, an error was printed and restic continued, ignoring even the existing exclude files. Now, an error message is printed and restic aborts when an exclude file cannot be read.\r\n\r\n    [#1893](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1893) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1861: Fix case-insensitive search with restic find\r\n\r\n   We've fixed the behavior for `restic find -i PATTERN`, which was broken in v0.9.1.\r\n\r\n    [#1861](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1861) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1906: Add support for B2 application keys\r\n\r\n   Restic can now use so-called \"application keys\" which can be created in the B2 dashboard and were only introduced recently. In contrast to the \"master key\", such keys can be restricted to a specific bucket and/or path.\r\n\r\n    [#1906](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1906) [#1914](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1914) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #874: Add stats command to get information about a repository\r\n\r\n    [#874](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/874) [#1729](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1729) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1772: Add restore --verify to verify restored file content\r\n\r\n   Restore will print error message if restored file content does not match expected SHA256 checksum\r\n\r\n    [#1772](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1772) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1853: Add JSON output support to `restic key list`\r\n\r\n   This PR enables users to get the output of `restic key list` in JSON in addition to the existing table format.\r\n\r\n    [#1853](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1853) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1477: S3 backend: accept AWS_SESSION_TOKEN\r\n\r\n   Before, it was not possible to use s3 backend with AWS temporary security credentials(with AWS_SESSION_TOKEN). This change gives higher priority to credentials.EnvAWS credentials provider.\r\n\r\n    [#1477](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1477) [#1479](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1479) [#1647](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1647) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1901: Update the Backblaze B2 library\r\n\r\n   We've updated the library we're using for accessing the Backblaze B2 service to 0.5.0 to include support for upcoming so-called \"application keys\". With this feature, you can create access credentials for B2 which are restricted to e.g. a single bucket or even a sub-directory of a bucket.\r\n\r\n    [#1901](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1901) https://github.com/kurin/blazer\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#1801](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1801): Add limiting bandwidth to the rclone backend\r\n * Fix [#1822](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1822): Allow uploading large files to MS Azure\r\n * Fix [#1825](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1825): Correct `find` to not skip snapshots\r\n * Fix [#1833](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1833): Fix caching files on error\r\n * Fix [#1834](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1834): Resolve deadlock\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1801: Add limiting bandwidth to the rclone backend\r\n\r\n   The rclone backend did not respect `--limit-upload` or `--limit-download`. Oftentimes it's not necessary to use this, as the limiting in rclone itself should be used because it gives much better results, but in case a remote instance of rclone is used (e.g. called via ssh), it is still relevant to limit the bandwidth from restic to rclone.\r\n\r\n    [#1801](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1801) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1822: Allow uploading large files to MS Azure\r\n\r\n   Sometimes, restic creates files to be uploaded to the repository which are quite large, e.g. when saving directories with many entries or very large files. The MS Azure API does not allow uploading files larger that 256MiB directly, rather restic needs to upload them in blocks of 100MiB. This is now implemented.\r\n\r\n    [#1822](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1822) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1825: Correct `find` to not skip snapshots\r\n\r\n   Under certain circumstances, the `find` command was found to skip snapshots containing directories with files to look for when the directories haven't been modified at all, and were already printed as part of a different snapshot. This is now corrected.\r\n\r\n   In addition, we've switched to our own matching/pattern implementation, so now things like `restic find \"/home/user/foo/**/main.go\"` are possible.\r\n\r\n    [#1825](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1825) [#1823](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1823) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1833: Fix caching files on error\r\n\r\n   During `check` it may happen that different threads access the same file in the backend, which is then downloaded into the cache only once. When that fails, only the thread which is responsible for downloading the file signals the correct error. The other threads just assume that the file has been downloaded successfully and then get an error when they try to access the cached file.\r\n\r\n    [#1833](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1833) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1834: Resolve deadlock\r\n\r\n   When the \"scanning\" process restic runs to find out how much data there is does not finish before the backup itself is done, restic stops doing anything. This is resolved now.\r\n\r\n    [#1834](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1834) [#1835](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1835) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Now, invalid files are ignored for the normal lock check, and removed when `restic unlock --remove-all` is run.\r\n\r\n    [#1652](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1652) [#1653](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1653) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1730: Ignore sockets for restore\r\n\r\n   We've received a report and correct the behavior in which the restore code aborted restoring a directory when a socket was encountered. Unix domain socket files cannot be restored (they are created on the fly once a process starts listening). The error handling was corrected, and in addition we're now ignoring sockets during restore.\r\n\r\n    [#1730](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1730) [#1731](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1731) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1684: Fix backend tests for rest-server\r\n\r\n   The REST server for restic now requires an explicit parameter (`--no-auth`) if no authentication should be allowed. This is fixed in the tests.\r\n\r\n    [#1684](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1684) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1745: Correctly parse the argument to --tls-client-cert\r\n\r\n   Previously, the --tls-client-cert method attempt to read ARGV[1] (hardcoded) instead of the argument that was passed to it. This has been corrected.\r\n\r\n    [#1745](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1745) [#1746](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1746) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1433: Support UTF-16 encoding and process Byte Order Mark\r\n\r\n   On Windows, text editors commonly leave a Byte Order Mark at the beginning of the file to define which encoding is used (oftentimes UTF-16). We've added code to support processing the BOMs in text files, like the exclude files, the password file and the file passed via `--files-from`. This does not apply to any file being saved in a backup, those are not touched and archived as they are.\r\n\r\n    [#1433](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1433) [#1738](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1738) [#1748](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1748) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1561: Allow using rclone to access other services\r\n\r\n   We've added the ability to use rclone to store backup data on all backends that it supports. This was done in collaboration with Nick, the author of rclone. You can now use it to first configure a service, then restic manages the rest (starting and stopping rclone). For details, please see the manual.\r\n\r\n    [#1561](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1561) [#1657](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1657) https://rclone.org\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1665: Improve cache handling for `restic check`\r\n\r\n   For safety reasons, restic does not use a local metadata cache for the `restic check` command, so that data is loaded from the repository and restic can check it's in good condition. When the cache is disabled, restic will fetch each tiny blob needed for checking the integrity using a separate backend request. For non-local backends, that will take a long time, and depending on the backend (e.g. B2) may also be much more expensive.\r\n\r\n   This PR adds a few commits which will change the behavior as follows:\r\n\r\n   * When `restic check` is called without any additional parameters, it will build a new cache in a temporary directory, which is removed at the end of the check. This way, we'll get readahead for metadata files (so restic will fetch the whole file when the first blob from the file is requested), but all data is freshly fetched from the storage backend. This is the default behavior and will work for almost all users.\r\n\r\n   * When `restic check` is called with `--with-cache`, the default on-disc cache is used. This behavior hasn't changed since the cache was introduced.\r\n\r\n   * When `--no-cache` is specified, restic falls back to the old behavior, and read all tiny blobs in separate requests.\r\n\r\n    [#1665](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1665) [#1694](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1694) [#1696](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1696) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1721: Add `cache` command to list cache dirs\r\n\r\n   The command `cache` was added, it allows listing restic's cache directoriers together with the last usage. It also allows removing old cache dirs without having to access a repo, via `restic cache --cleanup`\r\n\r\n    [#1721](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1721) [#1749](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1749) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1758: Allow saving OneDrive folders in Windows\r\n\r\n   Restic now contains a bugfix to two libraries, which allows saving OneDrive folders in Windows. In order to use the newer versions of the libraries, the minimal version required to compile restic is now Go 1.9.\r\n\r\n    [#1758](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1758) [#1765](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1765) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #549: Rework archiver code\r\n\r\n   The core archiver code and the complementary code for the `backup` command was rewritten completely. This resolves very annoying issues such as 549. The first backup with this release of restic will likely result in all files being re-read locally, so it will take a lot longer. The next backup after that will be fast again.\r\n\r\n   Basically, with the old code, restic took the last path component of each to-be-saved file or directory as the top-level file/directory within the snapshot. This meant that when called as `restic backup /home/user/foo`, the snapshot would contain the files in the directory `/home/user/foo` as `/foo`.\r\n\r\n   This is not the case any more with the new archiver code. Now, restic works very similar to what `tar` does: When restic is called with an absolute path to save, then it'll preserve the directory structure within the snapshot. For the example above, the snapshot would contain the files in the directory within `/home/user/foo` in the snapshot. For relative directories, it only preserves the relative path components. So `restic backup user/foo` will save the files as `/user/foo` in the snapshot.\r\n\r\n   While we were at it, the status display and notification system was completely rewritten. By default, restic now shows which files are currently read (unless `--quiet` is specified) in a multi-line status display.\r\n\r\n   The `backup` command also gained a new option: `--verbose`. It can be specified once (which prints a bit more detail what restic is doing) or twice (which prints a line for each file/directory restic encountered, together with some statistics).\r\n\r\n   Another issue that was resolved is the new code only reads two files at most. The old code would read way too many files in parallel, thereby slowing down the backup process on spinning discs a lot.\r\n\r\n    [#549](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/549) [#1286](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1286) [#446](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/446) [#1344](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1344) [#1416](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1416) [#1456](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1456) [#1145](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1145) [#1160](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1160) [#1494](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1494) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1552: Use Google Application Default credentials\r\n\r\n   Google provide libraries to generate appropriate credentials with various fallback sources. This change uses the library to generate our GCS client, which allows us to make use of these extra methods.\r\n\r\n   This should be backward compatible with previous restic behaviour while adding the additional capabilities to auth from Google's internal metadata endpoints. For users running restic in GCP this can make authentication far easier than it was before.\r\n\r\n    [#1552](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1552) https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1477: Accept AWS_SESSION_TOKEN for the s3 backend\r\n\r\n   Before, it was not possible to use s3 backend with AWS temporary security credentials(with AWS_SESSION_TOKEN). This change gives higher priority to credentials.EnvAWS credentials provider.\r\n\r\n    [#1477](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1477) [#1479](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1479) [#1647](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1647) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1648: Ignore AWS permission denied error when creating a repository\r\n\r\n   It's not possible to use s3 backend scoped to a subdirectory(with specific permissions). Restic doesn't try to create repository in a subdirectory, when 'bucket exists' of parent directory check fails due to permission issues.\r\n\r\n    [#1648](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1648) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1649: Add illumos/Solaris support\r\n\r\n    [#1649](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1649) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1709: Improve messages `restic check` prints\r\n\r\n   Some messages `restic check` prints are not really errors, so from now on restic does not treat them as errors any more and exits cleanly.\r\n\r\n    [#1709](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1709) https://forum.restic.net/t/what-is-the-standard-procedure-to-follow-if-a-backup-or-restore-is-interrupted/571/2\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #827: Add --new-password-file flag for non-interactive password changes\r\n\r\n   This makes it possible to change a repository password without being prompted.\r\n\r\n    [#827](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/827) [#1720](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1720) https://forum.restic.net/t/changing-repo-password-without-prompt/591\r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1735: Allow keeping a time range of snaphots\r\n\r\n   We've added the `--keep-within` option to the `forget` command. It instructs restic to keep all snapshots within the given duration since the newest snapshot. For example, running `restic forget --keep-within 5m7d` will keep all snapshots which have been made in the five months and seven days since the latest snapshot.\r\n\r\n    [#1735](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1735) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1782: Use default AWS credentials chain for S3 backend\r\n\r\n   Adds support for file credentials to the S3 backend (e.g. ~/.aws/credentials), and reorders the credentials chain for the S3 backend to match AWS's standard, which is static credentials, env vars, credentials file, and finally remote.\r\n\r\n    [#1782](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1782) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "We're very pleased to announce restic 0.8.3! restic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net).\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can easily reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that are contained in the [builder repository](https://github.com/restic/builder).\r\n\r\nFor the 0.8.3 release, the binaries are a bit harder to reproduce since Go 1.10 changed a command-line parameter we're using, and we did not catch this early enough for the release. Instructions on how to reproduce them can be found [in the forum](https://forum.restic.net/t/reproducible-build-is-it-working/490).\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.8.3 (2018-02-26)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.8.3 relevant to restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#1633](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1633): Fixed unexpected 'pack file cannot be listed' error\r\n * Fix [#1641](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1641): Ignore files with invalid names in the repo\r\n * Fix [#1638](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1638): Handle errors listing files in the backend\r\n * Enh [#1497](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1497): Add --read-data-subset flag to check command\r\n * Enh [#1560](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1560): Retry all repository file download errors\r\n * Enh [#1623](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1623): Don't check for presence of files in the backend before writing\r\n * Enh [#1634](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1634): Upgrade B2 client library, reduce HTTP requests\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1633: Fixed unexpected 'pack file cannot be listed' error\r\n\r\n   Due to a regression introduced in 0.8.2, the `rebuild-index` and `prune` commands failed to read pack files with size of 587, 588, 589 or 590 bytes.\r\n\r\n    [#1633](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1633) [#1635](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1635) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1641: Ignore files with invalid names in the repo\r\n\r\n   The release 0.8.2 introduced a bug: when restic encounters files in the repo which do not have a valid name, it tries to load a file with a name of lots of zeroes instead of ignoring it. This is now resolved, invalid file names are just ignored.\r\n\r\n    [#1641](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1641) [#1643](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1643) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1638: Handle errors listing files in the backend\r\n\r\n   A user reported in the forum that restic completes a backup although a concurrent `prune` operation was running. A few error messages were printed, but the backup was attempted and completed successfully. No error code was returned.\r\n\r\n   This should not happen: The repository is exclusively locked during `prune`, so when `restic backup` is run in parallel, it should abort and return an error code instead.\r\n\r\n   It was found that the bug was in the code introduced only recently, which retries a List() operation on the backend should that fail. It is now corrected.\r\n\r\n    [#1638](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1638) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1497: Add --read-data-subset flag to check command\r\n\r\n   This change introduces ability to check integrity of a subset of repository data packs. This can be used to spread integrity check of larger repositories over a period of time.\r\n\r\n    [#1497](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1497) [#1556](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1556) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1560: Retry all repository file download errors\r\n\r\n   Restic will now retry failed downloads, similar to other operations.\r\n\r\n    [#1560](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1560) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1623: Don't check for presence of files in the backend before writing\r\n\r\n   Before, all backend implementations were required to return an error if the file that is to be written already exists in the backend. For most backends, that means making a request (e.g. via HTTP) and returning an error when the file already exists.\r\n\r\n   This is not accurate, the file could have been created between the HTTP request testing for it, and when writing starts, so we've relaxed this requeriment, which saves one additional HTTP request per newly added file.\r\n\r\n    [#1623](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1623) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1634: Upgrade B2 client library, reduce HTTP requests\r\n\r\n   We've upgraded the B2 client library restic uses to access BackBlaze B2. This reduces the number of HTTP requests needed to upload a new file from two to one, which should improve throughput to B2.\r\n\r\n    [#1634](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1634) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#1506](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1506): Limit bandwith at the http.RoundTripper for HTTP based backends\r\n * Fix [#1512](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1512): Restore directory permissions as the last step\r\n * Fix [#1528](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1528): Correctly create missing subdirs in data/\r\n * Fix [#1590](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1590): Strip spaces for lines read via --files-from\r\n * Fix [#1589](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1589): Complete intermediate index upload\r\n * Fix [#1594](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1594): Google Cloud Storage: Use generic HTTP transport\r\n * Fix [#1595](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1595): Backup: Remove bandwidth display\r\n * Enh [#1522](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1522): Add support for TLS client certificate authentication\r\n * Enh [#1541](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1541): Reduce number of remote requests during repository check\r\n * Enh [#1567](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1567): Reduce number of backend requests for rebuild-index and prune\r\n * Enh [#1507](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1507): Only reload snapshots once per minute for fuse mount\r\n * Enh [#1538](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1538): Reduce memory allocations for querying the index\r\n * Enh [#1549](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1549): Speed up querying across indices and scanning existing files\r\n * Enh [#1554](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1554): Fuse/mount: Correctly handle EOF, add template option\r\n * Enh [#1564](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1564): Don't terminate ssh on SIGINT\r\n * Enh [#1579](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1579): Retry Backend.List() in case of errors\r\n * Enh [#1584](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1584): Limit index file size\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1506: Limit bandwith at the http.RoundTripper for HTTP based backends\r\n\r\n    [#1506](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1506) [#1511](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1511) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1512: Restore directory permissions as the last step\r\n\r\n   This change allows restoring into directories that were not writable during backup. Before, restic created the directory, set the read-only mode and then failed to create files in the directory. This change now restores the directory (with its permissions) as the very last step.\r\n\r\n    [#1512](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1512) [#1536](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1536) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1528: Correctly create missing subdirs in data/\r\n\r\n    [#1528](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1528) [#1529](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1529) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1590: Strip spaces for lines read via --files-from\r\n\r\n   Leading and trailing spaces in lines read via `--files-from` are now stripped, so it behaves the same as with lines read via `--exclude-file`.\r\n\r\n    [#1590](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1590) [#1613](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1613) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1589: Complete intermediate index upload\r\n\r\n   After a user posted a comprehensive report of what he observed, we were able to find a bug and correct it: During backup, restic uploads so-called \"intermediate\" index files. When the backup finishes during a transfer of such an intermediate index, the upload is cancelled, but the backup is finished without an error. This leads to an inconsistent state, where the snapshot references data that is contained in the repo, but is not referenced in any index.\r\n\r\n   The situation can be resolved by building a new index with `rebuild-index`, but looks very confusing at first. Since all the data got uploaded to the repo successfully, there was no risk of data loss, just minor inconvenience for our users.\r\n\r\n    [#1589](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1589) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1594: Google Cloud Storage: Use generic HTTP transport\r\n\r\n   It was discovered that the Google Cloud Storage backend did not use the generic HTTP transport, so things such as bandwidth limiting with `--limit-upload` did not work. This is resolved now.\r\n\r\n    [#1594](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1594) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1595: Backup: Remove bandwidth display\r\n\r\n   This commit removes the bandwidth displayed during backup process. It is misleading and seldomly correct, because it's neither the \"read bandwidth\" (only for the very first backup) nor the \"upload bandwidth\". Many users are confused about (and rightly so), c.f. #1581, #1033, #1591\r\n\r\n   We'll eventually replace this display with something more relevant when the new archiver code is ready.\r\n\r\n    [#1595](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1595) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1522: Add support for TLS client certificate authentication\r\n\r\n   Support has been added for using a TLS client certificate for authentication to HTTP based backend. A file containing the PEM encoded private key and certificate can be set using the `--tls-client-cert` option.\r\n\r\n    [#1522](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1522) [#1524](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1524) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1541: Reduce number of remote requests during repository check\r\n\r\n   This change eliminates redundant remote repository calls and significantly improves repository check time.\r\n\r\n    [#1541](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1541) [#1548](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1548) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1567: Reduce number of backend requests for rebuild-index and prune\r\n\r\n   We've found a way to reduce then number of backend requests for the `rebuild-index` and `prune` operations. This significantly speeds up the operations for high-latency backends.\r\n\r\n    [#1567](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1567) [#1574](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1574) [#1575](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1575) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1507: Only reload snapshots once per minute for fuse mount\r\n\r\n    [#1507](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1507) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1538: Reduce memory allocations for querying the index\r\n\r\n   This change reduces the internal memory allocations when the index data structures in memory are queried if a blob (part of a file) already exists in the repo. It should speed up backup a bit, and maybe even reduce RAM usage.\r\n\r\n    [#1538](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1538) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1549: Speed up querying across indices and scanning existing files\r\n\r\n   This change increases the whenever a blob (part of a file) is searched for in a restic repository.  This will reduce cpu usage some when backing up files already backed up by restic.  Cpu usage is further decreased when scanning files.\r\n\r\n    [#1549](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1549) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1554: Fuse/mount: Correctly handle EOF, add template option\r\n\r\n   We've added the `--snapshot-template` string, which can be used to specify a template for a snapshot directory. In addition, accessing data after the end of a file via the fuse mount is now handled correctly.\r\n\r\n    [#1554](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1554) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1564: Don't terminate ssh on SIGINT\r\n\r\n   We've reworked the code which runs the `ssh` login for the sftp backend so that it can prompt for a password (if needed) but does not exit when the user presses CTRL+C (SIGINT) e.g. during backup. This allows restic to properly shut down when it receives SIGINT and remove the lock file from the repo, afterwards exiting the `ssh` process.\r\n\r\n    [#1564](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1564) [#1588](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1588) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1579: Retry Backend.List() in case of errors\r\n\r\n    [#1579](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1579) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1584: Limit index file size\r\n\r\n   Before, restic would create a single new index file on `prune` or `rebuild-index`, this may lead to memory problems when this huge index is created and loaded again. We're now limiting the size of the index file, and split newly created index files into several smaller ones. This allows restic to be more memory-efficient.\r\n\r\n    [#1412](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1412) [#979](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/979) [#526](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/526) [#1584](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1584) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "We're very pleased to announce restic 0.8.1! restic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net).\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can easily reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that are contained in the [builder repository](https://github.com/restic/builder).\r\n\r\nChangelog for restic 0.8.1 (2017-12-27)\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThe following sections list the changes in restic 0.8.1 relevant to\r\nrestic users. The changes are ordered by importance.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Fix [#1457](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1457): Improve s3 backend with DigitalOcean Spaces\r\n * Fix [#1454](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1454): Correct cache dir location for Windows and Darwin\r\n * Fix [#1459](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1459): Disable handling SIGPIPE\r\n * Chg [#1452](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1452): Do not save atime by default\r\n * Enh [#1436](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1436): Add code to detect old cache directories\r\n * Enh [#1439](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1439): Improve cancellation logic\r\n * Enh [#11](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/11): Add the `diff` command\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1457: Improve s3 backend with DigitalOcean Spaces\r\n\r\n    [#1457](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1457) [#1459](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1459) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1454: Correct cache dir location for Windows and Darwin\r\n\r\n   The cache directory on Windows and Darwin was not correct, instead the directory `.cache` was used.\r\n\r\n    [#1454](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1454) \r\n\r\n * Bugfix #1459: Disable handling SIGPIPE\r\n\r\n   We've disabled handling SIGPIPE again. Turns out, writing to broken TCP connections also raised SIGPIPE, so restic exits on the first write to a broken connection. Instead, restic should retry the request.\r\n\r\n    [#1457](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1457) [#1466](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1466) [#1459](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1459) \r\n\r\n * Change #1452: Do not save atime by default\r\n\r\n   By default, the access time for files and dirs is not saved any more. It is not possible to reliably disable updating the access time during a backup, so for the next backup the access time is different again. This means a lot of metadata is saved. If you want to save the access time anyway, pass `--with-atime` to the `backup` command.\r\n\r\n    [#1452](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1452) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1436: Add code to detect old cache directories\r\n\r\n   We've added code to detect old cache directories of repositories that haven't been used in a long time, restic now prints a note when it detects that such dirs exist. Also, the option `--cleanup-cache` was added to automatically remove such directories. That's not a problem because the cache will be rebuild once a repo is accessed again.\r\n\r\n    [#1436](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1436) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #1439: Improve cancellation logic\r\n\r\n   The cancellation logic was improved, restic can now shut down cleanly when requested to do so (e.g. via ctrl+c).\r\n\r\n    [#1439](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1439) \r\n\r\n * Enhancement #11: Add the `diff` command\r\n\r\n   The command `diff` was added, it allows comparing two snapshots and listing all differences.\r\n\r\n    [#11](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/11) [#1460](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1460) [#1462](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1462) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "We're very pleased to announce restic 0.8.0! restic is distributed as a standalone binary: download the correct file for your operating system and architecture, extract the file and just run it. If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net).\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can easily reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that are contained in the [builder repository](https://github.com/restic/builder).\r\n\r\nImportant Changes in 0.8.0\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n * A vulnerability was found in the restic restorer, which allowed attackers in special circumstances to restore files to a location outside of the target directory. Due to the circumstances we estimate this to be a low-risk vulnerability, but urge all users to upgrade to the latest version of restic.\r\n\r\n   Exploiting the vulnerability requires a Linux/Unix system which saves backups via restic and a Windows system which restores files from the repo. In addition, the attackers need to be able to create files with arbitrary names which are then saved to the restic repo. For example, by creating a file named \"..\\test.txt\" (which is a perfectly legal filename on Linux) and restoring a snapshot containing this file on Windows, it would be written to the parent of the target directory.\r\n\r\n   We'd like to thank [Tyler Spivey](https://allinaccess.com/) for reporting this responsibly!\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1445\r\n\r\n * The s3 backend used the subdir `restic` within a bucket if no explicit path after the bucket name was specified. Since this version, restic does not use this default path any more. If you created a repo on s3 in a bucket without specifying a path within the bucket, you need to add `/restic` at the end of the repository specification to access your repo: `s3:s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/restic` https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1292 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1437\r\n\r\n * We've added a local cache for metadata so that restic doesn't need to load all metadata (snapshots, indexes, ...) from the repo each time it starts. By default the cache is active, but there's a new global option `--no-cache` that can be used to disable the cache. By deafult, the cache a standard cache folder for the OS, which can be overridden with `--cache-dir`.  The cache will automatically populate, indexes and snapshots are saved as they are loaded. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1040 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/29 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/738 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/282 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1287\r\n\r\n * A related change was to by default create pack files in the repo that contain either data or metadata, not both mixed together. This allows easy caching of only the metadata files. The next run of `restic prune` will untangle mixed files automatically. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1265\r\n\r\n * The Google Cloud Storage backend no longer requires the service account to have the `storage.buckets.get` permission (\"Storage Admin\" role) in `restic init` if the bucket already exists. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1281\r\n\r\n * Added support for rate limiting through `--limit-upload` and `--limit-download` flags. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1216 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1336 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1358\r\n\r\n * Failed backend requests are now automatically retried. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1353\r\n\r\n * We've added the `dump` command which prints a file from a snapshot to stdout. This can e.g. be used to restore files read with `backup --stdin`. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/510 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1346\r\n\r\nSmall changes\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n * The directory structure in the fuse mount now exposes a symlink `latest` which points to the latest snapshot in that particular directory. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1249\r\n\r\n * The option `--compact` was added to the `forget` command to provide the same compact view as the `snapshots` command. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1269\r\n\r\n * We've re-enabled a workaround for `minio-go` (the library we're using to access s3 backends), this reduces memory usage. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1256 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1267\r\n\r\n * The sftp backend now prompts for the password if a password is necessary for login. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/448 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1270\r\n\r\n * The `generate` command has been added, which replaces the now removed commands `manpage` and `autocomplete`. This release of restic contains the most recent manpages in `doc/man` and the auto-completion files for bash and zsh in `doc/bash-completion.sh` and `doc/zsh-completion.zsh` https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1274 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1282\r\n\r\n * A bug was discovered in the library we're using to access Backblaze, it now reuses already established TCP connections which should be a lot faster and not cause network failures any more. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1291 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1301\r\n\r\n * Another bug in the `forget` command caused `prune` not to be run when `--prune` was specified without a policy, e.g. when only snapshot IDs that should be forgotten are listed manually. This is corrected now. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1317\r\n\r\n * The `check` command now explicetly prints `No errors were found` when no errors could be found. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1319 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1303\r\n\r\n * The fuse mount now has an `ids` subdirectory which contains the snapshots below their (short) IDs. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1102 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1299 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1320\r\n\r\n * The `backup` command was improved, it now caches the result of excludes for a directory. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1271 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1326\r\n\r\n * We've added the `--cacert` option which can be used to pass one (or more) CA certificates to restic. These are used in addition to the system CA certificates to verify HTTPS certificates (e.g. for the REST backend). https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1114 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1276\r\n\r\n * When the list of files/dirs to be saved is read from a file with `--files-from`, comment lines (starting with `#`) are now ignored. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1367 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1368\r\n",

If you run into any issues, please report them at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) or visit [the forum](https://forum.restic.net).\r\n\r\nThe binaries released with each restic version are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can easily reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that are contained in the [builder repository](https://github.com/restic/builder).\r\n\r\nThis is a bugfix release that corrects the following bugs:\r\n\r\nImportant Changes in 0.7.3\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n * For large backups stored in Google Cloud Storage, the `prune` command fails because listing only returns the first 1000 files. This has been corrected, no data is lost in the process. In addition, a plausibility check was added to `prune`.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1246\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1247\r\n",

Instructions on how to do that are contained in the [builder repository](https://github.com/restic/builder).\r\n\r\nThis release contains the following changes:\r\n\r\nImportant Changes in 0.7.2\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n * We've added an official docker image and a Dockerfile to build this image in\r\n   `docker/`.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1061\r\n\r\n * The git repository layout was changed to resemble the layout typically used\r\n   in Go projects, we're not using `gb` for building restic any more and\r\n   vendoring the dependencies is now taken care of by `dep`.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1126\r\n\r\n * We now support saving backups on Google Cloud Storage.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1134\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1052\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/211\r\n\r\n * We've added support for Microsoft Azure Blob Storage as a restic backend.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1149\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1059\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/609\r\n\r\n * In the course of supporting Microsoft Azure Blobe Storage Go 1.8 is now a\r\n   requirement to build restic.\r\n\r\n * The `restore` command has been improved: When dirs are excluded (or not\r\n   included) in a restore, they are not loaded from the repo any more.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1044\r\n\r\n * Name collisions are now resolved by appending a counter.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1179\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1209\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall changes\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n * The `key` command now prompts for a password even if the original password\r\n   to access a repo has been specified via the `RESTIC_PASSWORD` environment\r\n   variable or a password file.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1132\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1133\r\n\r\n * Properly report errors when reading files with exclude patterns.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1144\r\n\r\n * We now automatically generate man pages for all restic commands, see the\r\n   subdir `doc/man`.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/697\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1147\r\n\r\n * The `key remove` command was corrected and now works as documented.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1164\r\n\r\n * When a restic command other than `init` is used with a local repository and\r\n   the repository directory does not exist, restic creates the directory\r\n   structure. That's an error, only the `init` command should create the dir.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1167\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1182\r\n\r\n * Restic now prints stats on all BSD systems (not only on darwin) when SIGINFO\r\n   is received (usually when ctrl+t is pressed).\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1203\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1082#issuecomment-326279920\r\n\r\n * Since a few releases restic had the ability to write profiling files for\r\n   memory and CPU usage when `debug` is enabled. It was discovered that when\r\n   restic is interrupted (ctrl+c is pressed), the proper shutdown hook is not\r\n   run. This is now corrected.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1191\r\n\r\n * A new option `--exclude-caches` was added that allows excluding cache\r\n   directories (that are tagged as such). This is a special case of a more\r\n   generic option `--exclude-if-present` which excludes a directory if a file\r\n   with a specific name (and contents) is present.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/317\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1170\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1224\r\n\r\n * The `forget` command now has an option `--group-by` that allows flexible\r\n   grouping policies.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1196\r\n\r\n * The date and time restic records for a new backup can now be specified\r\n   externally by passing `--time` to the `backup` command.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1205\r\n\r\n * The option `--compact` was added to the `snapshots` command to get a better\r\n   overview of the snapshots in a repo. It limits each snapshot to a single\r\n   line.\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1218\r\n   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1223\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "UPDATE\r\n======\r\n\r\nAfter releasing restic 0.7.1, we've discovered a serious bug that was more or less accidentally corrected in 0.7.1, the background story is described [in our blog](https://restic.github.io/blog/2017-07-25/please-upgrade-to-0.7.1). **Do not use restic 0.7.0, upgrade to at least 0.7.1**\r\n\r\nAnd now the original release notes text:\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're proud to present restic 0.7.1. The binaries released with each restic version starting are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/), which means that you can easily reproduce a byte identical version from the source code for that release. Instructions on how to do that are contained in the [builder repository](https://github.com/restic/builder).\r\n\r\nImportant Changes in 0.7.1\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n * The `migrate` command for chaning the `s3legacy` layout to the `default` layout for s3 backends has been improved: It can now be restarted with `restic migrate --force s3_layout` and automatically retries operations on error. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1073 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1075\r\n\r\nSmall changes\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n * The local and sftp backends now create the subdirs below `data/` on open/init. This way, restic makes sure that they always exist. This is connected to an issue for the sftp server: https://github.com/restic/rest-server/pull/11#issuecomment-309879710 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1055 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1077 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1105\r\n\r\n * When no S3 credentials are specified in the environment variables, restic now tries to load credentials from an IAM instance profile when the s3 backend is used. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1067 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1086\r\n\r\n * On Darwin and FreeBSD, restic now prints stats when SIGINFO is received (usually when ctrl+t is pressed). https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1082\r\n\r\n * The dependencies have been updated. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1108 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1124\r\n\r\n * A bug was found (and corrected) in the index rebuilding after prune, which led to indexes which include blobs that were not present in the repo any more. There were already checks in place which detected this situation and aborted with an error message. A new run of either `prune` or `rebuild-index` corrected the index files. This is now fixed and a test has been added to detect this. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1115\r\n\r\n * Errors for chmod() on Unix for filesystems which do not support it (e.g. smb mounted via gvfs) are now ignored. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1080 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1112\r\n\r\n * The semantic for the `--tags` option to `forget` and `snapshots` was clarified: https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1081 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1090\r\n",

    "body": "After weeks of work we're proud to release restic 0.7.0!\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Changes in 0.7.0\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n * New \"swift\" backend: A new backend for the OpenStack Swift cloud storage protocol has been added, https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/975 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/648\r\n\r\n * New \"b2\" backend: A new backend for Backblaze B2 cloud storage service has been added, https://www.backblaze.com https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/512 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/978\r\n\r\n * Improved performance for the `find` command: Restic recognizes paths it has already checked for the files in question, so the number of backend requests is reduced a lot. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/989 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/993\r\n\r\n * Improved performance for the fuse mount: Listing directories which contain large files now is significantly faster. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/998\r\n\r\n * The default layout for the s3 backend is now `default` (instead of `s3legacy`). Also, there's a new `migrate` command to convert an existing repo, it can be run like this: `restic migrate s3_layout` https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/965 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1004\r\n\r\n * The fuse mount now has two more directories: `tags` contains a subdir for each tag, which in turn contains only the snapshots that have this tag. The subdir `hosts` contains a subdir for each host that has a snapshot, and the subdir contains the snapshots for that host. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/636 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1050\r\n\r\nSmall changes\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n * For the s3 backend we're back to using the high-level API the s3 client library for uploading data, a few users reported dropped connections (which the library will automatically retry now). https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1013 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1023 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1025\r\n\r\n * The `prune` command has been improved and will now remove invalid pack files, for example files that have not been uploaded completely because a backup was interrupted. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1029 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1036\r\n\r\n * restic now tries to detect when an invalid/unknown backend is used and returns an error message. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1021 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1070\r\n",

    "body": "This is mostly a bugfix release and only contains small changes:\r\n\r\n * The release binaries are now built in a reproducible way, see https://github.com/restic/builder\r\n\r\n * We've fixed a bug where `rebuild-index` would corrupt the index when used with the s3 backend together with the `default` layout. This is not the default setting.\r\n\r\n * Backends based on HTTP now allow several idle connections in parallel. This is especially important for the REST backend, which (when used with a local server) may create a lot connections and exhaust available ports quickly. https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/985 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/986\r\n\r\n * Regular status report: We've removed the status report that was printed every 10 seconds when restic is run non-interactively. You can still force reporting the current status by sending a `USR1` signal to the process. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/974\r\n\r\n * The `build.go` now strips the temporary directory used for compilation from the binary. This is the first step in enabling reproducible builds. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/981\r\n\r\n# Change Log\r\n\r\n## [v0.6.1](https://github.com/restic/restic/tree/v0.6.1) (2017-05-31)\r\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/restic/restic/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1)\r\n\r\n**Fixed bugs:**\r\n\r\n- \"restic check\" with rest-backend is using up too many fd's on rest-server. [\\#985](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/985)\r\n- Running rebuild-index on s3 with new default layout corrupts index [\\#984](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/984)\r\n- AWS credentials ending in \"=\" don't work [\\#970](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/970)\r\n\r\n**Closed issues:**\r\n\r\n- Slow \"restic prune\" on Amazon s3 bucket [\\#973](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/973)\r\n\r\n**Merged pull requests:**\r\n\r\n- \\[docs\\] Fix paragraph not indented correctly in \\#Autocomplete [\\#987](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/987) ([Thor77](https://github.com/Thor77))\r\n- Allow many idle connections per host [\\#986](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/986) ([fd0](https://github.com/fd0))\r\n- build.go: Strip temporary path, allow reproducible builds [\\#981](https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/981) ([fd0](https://github.com/fd0))\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "After two months of work we're proud to announce restic v0.6.0. This release contains many bug fixes and several improvements for the user interface, the most important changes are listed below (and also contained in the `CHANGELOG.md`.\r\n\r\nImportant Changes in 0.6.0\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nConsistent forget policy\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThe `forget` command was corrected to be more consistent in which snapshots are to be forgotten. It is possible that the new code removes more snapshots than before, so please review what would be deleted by using the `--dry-run` option. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/957 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/953\r\n\r\nUnified repository layout\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nUp to now the s3 backend used a special repository layout. We've decided to unify the repository layout and implemented the default layout also for the s3 backend. For creating a new repository on s3 with the default layout, use `restic -o s3.layout=default init`. For further commands the option is not necessary any more, restic will automatically detect the correct layout to use. A future version will switch to the default layout for new repositories. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/966 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/965\r\n\r\nMemory and time improvements for the s3 backend\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe've updated the library used for accessing s3, switched to using a lower level API and added caching for some requests. This lead to a decrease in memory usage and a great speedup. In addition, we added benchmark functions for all backends, so we can track improvements over time. The Continuous Integration test service we're using (Travis) now runs the s3 backend tests not only against a Minio server, but also against the Amazon s3 live service, so we should be notified of any regressions much sooner. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/962 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/960 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/946 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/938 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/883\r\n\r\n## [v0.6.0](https://github.com/restic/restic/tree/v0.6.0) (2017-05-25)\r\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/restic/restic/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0)\r\n\r\n**Implemented enhancements:**\r\n\r\n- \\[RFC\\] Implement consistent backup/forget policy [\\#953](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/953)\r\n- Temporary files not cleaned up [\\#948](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/948)\r\n- Check for config file before requesting password [\\#925](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/925)\r\n- use newer xattr [\\#921](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/921)\r\n- support plink as SSH/SFTP client on Windows [\\#818](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/818)\r\n- Handle filesystems mounted several times with --one-file-system [\\#645](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/645)\r\n- Backend: use AttemptGet instead of Test + Get to reduce latency impact [\\#457](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/457)\r\n\r\n**Fixed bugs:**\r\n\r\n- panic: store new item in finalized index [\\#969](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/969)\r\n- PKGBUILD broken [\\#963](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/963)\r\n- SFTP Upload Stops and does not recover [\\#937](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/937)\r\n- Restoring from different host saying `wrong password or no key found` [\\#923](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/923)\r\n- unable to open repo: wrong password or no key found [\\#917](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/917)\r\n- Empty lines in exclude-file result in empty snapshot [\\#915](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/915)\r\n- Design.md: Tree section has inconsistent blob IDs [\\#914](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/914)\r\n- Nested Backups Become Unnested [\\#910](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/910)\r\n- one-file-system does not correctly handle sub-paths [\\#907](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/907)\r\n- Backup fails after about 2GB [\\#904](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/904)\r\n- restic init doesn't work anymore with REST backend [\\#899](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/899)\r\n- device id is not saved for files [\\#893](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/893)\r\n- \\[S3\\] \\[EMC-ECS\\] client.BucketExists: Invalid Argument [\\#765](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/765)\r\n- Init error on windows when repo path begins with drive letter [\\#735](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/735)\r\n- backup --one-file-system and 'nested' mount points.

    "body": "After two months of work we're proud to announce restic v0.6.0. This is the Release Candidate version. If no grave bugs occur, it will be released as the final version in a few days. This release contains many bug fixes and several improvements for the user interface, the most important changes are listed below (and also contained in the `CHANGELOG.md`.\r\n\r\nImportant Changes in 0.6.0\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nConsistent forget policy\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThe `forget` command was corrected to be more consistent in which snapshots are to be forgotten. It is possible that the new code removes more snapshots than before, so please review what would be deleted by using the `--dry-run` option. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/957 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/953\r\n\r\nUnified repository layout\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nUp to now the s3 backend used a special repository layout. We've decided to unify the repository layout and implemented the default layout also for the s3 backend. For creating a new repository on s3 with the default layout, use `restic -o s3.layout=default init`. For further commands the option is not necessary any more, restic will automatically detect the correct layout to use. A future version will switch to the default layout for new repositories. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/966 https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/965\r\n\r\nMemory and time improvements for the s3 backend\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe've updated the library used for accessing s3, switched to using a lower level API and added caching for some requests. This lead to a decrease in memory usage and a great speedup. In addition, we added benchmark functions for all backends, so we can track improvements over time. The Continuous Integration test service we're using (Travis) now runs the s3 backend tests not only against a Minio server, but also against the Amazon s3 live service, so we should be notified of any regressions much sooner. https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/962 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/960 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/946 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/938 https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/883\r\n\r\n## [v0.6.0-rc.1](https://github.com/restic/restic/tree/v0.6.0-rc.1) (2017-05-25)\r\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/restic/restic/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0-rc.1)\r\n\r\n**Implemented enhancements:**\r\n\r\n- \\[RFC\\] Implement consistent backup/forget policy [\\#953](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/953)\r\n- Temporary files not cleaned up [\\#948](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/948)\r\n- Check for config file before requesting password [\\#925](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/925)\r\n- use newer xattr [\\#921](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/921)\r\n- support plink as SSH/SFTP client on Windows [\\#818](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/818)\r\n- Handle filesystems mounted several times with --one-file-system [\\#645](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/645)\r\n- Backend: use AttemptGet instead of Test + Get to reduce latency impact [\\#457](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/457)\r\n\r\n**Fixed bugs:**\r\n\r\n- panic: store new item in finalized index [\\#969](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/969)\r\n- PKGBUILD broken [\\#963](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/963)\r\n- SFTP Upload Stops and does not recover [\\#937](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/937)\r\n- Restoring from different host saying `wrong password or no key found` [\\#923](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/923)\r\n- unable to open repo: wrong password or no key found [\\#917](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/917)\r\n- Empty lines in exclude-file result in empty snapshot [\\#915](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/915)\r\n- Design.md: Tree section has inconsistent blob IDs [\\#914](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/914)\r\n- Nested Backups Become Unnested [\\#910](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/910)\r\n- one-file-system does not correctly handle sub-paths [\\#907](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/907)\r\n- Backup fails after about 2GB [\\#904](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/904)\r\n- restic init doesn't work anymore with REST backend [\\#899](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/899)\r\n- device id is not saved for files [\\#893](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/893)\r\n- \\[S3\\] \\[EMC-ECS\\] client.BucketExists: Invalid Argument [\\#765](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/765)\r\n- Init error on windows when repo path begins with drive letter [\\#735](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/735)\r\n- backup --one-file-system and 'nested' mount points.
