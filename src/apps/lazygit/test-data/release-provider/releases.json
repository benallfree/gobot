    "body": "Hold on tight because this is a HUGE release! This release includes a whopping 595 commits from a period of over 7 months, from 40 different contributors. Thanks to everybody who made this possible, and apologies for taking so long to actually release it: we'll be more frequent in future!\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Stefan Haller who is behind many of this release's changes and who has been critical in getting this release across the line.\r\n\r\nI've made a video running through the big changes here:\r\n\r\n[<img src=\"https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/assets/8456633/f9b47c5e-f8b2-4b41-8f51-bf06b01046e2\">](https://youtu.be/_REmkoIyPW0)\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\nHere's some highlighted features:\r\n\r\n### Range select\r\n\r\n![range-select](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/assets/demo/interactive_rebase-compressed.gif?raw=true)\r\n\r\nYou can now press 'v' to toggle range select in any list view, just like you already could in the staging view. You can also press shift+up/down to select a range. You can use range select to:\r\n* stage/discard a range of files\r\n* select multiple commits to fixup/squash/move outside an interactive rebase\r\n* select multiple commits to mark as fixup/squash/etc within an interactive rebase\r\n* select multiple commit files to discard or add to a custom patch (courtesy of @afhoffman)\r\n* select multiple commits to cherry-pick\r\n\r\nI have been waiting for this feature for a very long time and it's already made me way more productive. If I need to squash a range of commits I can now easily do it directly rather than needing to squash them one-by-one, or needing to manually start an interactive rebase first. Likewise, it's much easier to select a range of files and stage them than stage them one-by-one.\r\n\r\nThis is a **Breaking change**: Unfortunately, the 'v' key clashes with the existing key for pasting commits (cherry-pick), so we've replaced that with shift+V and changed the commit copy key to shift+C. If you want the old keybindings back, you can do that like so:\r\n```yml\r\nkeybinding:\r\n  universal:\r\n      toggleRangeSelect: <something other than v>\r\n    commits:\r\n      cherryPickCopy: 'c'\r\n      pasteCommits: 'v'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Auto-wrap in commit editor \r\n\r\nThe commit editor now automatically hard-wraps your content by default, so you no longer need to hit the enter key yourself when you approach the margin. You can disable/configure this in your config:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\ngit:\r\n  commit:\r\n    autoWrapCommitMessage: true\r\n    autoWrapWidth: 72\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks to @stefanhaller for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Easier remote branch checkout\r\n\r\nNow when you go to checkout a remote branch, either via the `c` keybinding in the branches view or by pressing `space` on a remote branch, you'll be given the choice to checkout as a local branch or as a detached head (previously it would just check it out as a detached head which typically isn't what you want). This is a **Breaking change** in terms of muscle memory.\r\n\r\nThanks to @stefanhaller for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Easier start interactive rebase\r\n\r\nPreviously, to start an interactive rebase, you would need to navigate to a base commit and press `e` on it. Now you can simply press `i` and regardless of which commit is selected, an interactive rebase will begin that includes all the commits on your branch (or if there are merge commits: all the commits up to first merge commit). \r\n\r\nThe above demo for range select showcases this.\r\n\r\n### Easier squashing of `fixup!` commits\r\n\r\nIn a similar vein to the above section, now when you press `shift+S`, you're given the choice of squashing all commits above the selected commit and squashing all commits on the branch, which is what you typically want. This is a **Breaking change** in terms of muscle memory.\r\n\r\nThanks to @stefanhaller for this feature.\r\n\r\n### View divergence from upstream branch\r\n\r\nIf you press `u` on a local branch a menu appears which shows options relating to the branch's upstream. Now, the first option in that menu allows you to view the divergence from the upstream which shows commits to pull and commits to push\r\n\r\nThanks to @stefanhaller for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Find appropriate commit for fixup/amend\r\n\r\nThis one is some serious voodoo: if somebody suggests changes in a PR review, you'll often apply the changes, then go hunting for the appropriate commit to fixup/amend. Now, from the files view you can press `ctrl+f` and if Lazygit can identify an appropriate commit with certainty, it will select that commit for you. Pretty cool!\r\n\r\nWe've made the algorithm very strict so that you can always trust the result, but this means in circumstances where we can't know for sure which commit is appropriate (such as when your changes only include added lines), it's left to you to manually find the commit. We're keen to get lots of feedback on this feature to see where the sweet spot is.\r\n\r\nFor more info see [the docs](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Fixup_Commits.md#finding-the-commit-to-create-a-fixup-for)\r\n\r\nThanks to @stefanhaller for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Delete remote branches/tags\r\n\r\nNow when you press `d` on a local branch, remote branch, or tag, you're given the option to delete that branch/tag in the remote.\r\n\r\nThanks to @AzraelSec for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Add co-author to commit\r\n\r\nWhen you press `a` on a commit an option now appears to add a co-author (something GitHub can read).\r\n\r\nThanks to @omaussa for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Filter commits by author\r\n\r\nYou can now filter commits by author via pressing `ctrl+s` in the commits view and selecting the option to filter by author.\r\n\r\nThanks to @Part22 for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Change branch sort order\r\n\r\nYou can now change branch sort order by pressing `s` in the branches view (and remote branches view). By default local branches are sorted by 'recency' meaning how recently they were checked out, but you can now sort by head commit date and alphabetically.\r\n\r\nThanks to @hosaka for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Better bare repo support\r\n\r\nWe have fixed a bunch of bugs relating to bare repos so if you had issues with them in the past it should work fine now.\r\n\r\nThanks to @jwhitley for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Miscelleneous UI changes\r\n\r\n* Unstaged files are now shown in white, not red, which is easier on the eyes\r\n* Scrollbars are thinner (and, thus, cooler)\r\n* Keybindings menu now has section headers (@stefanhaller) \r\n* Error toasts now appear for some errors (less intrusive than popups) (@stefanhaller)\r\n* Search history is now retained (@karimkhaleel)\r\n* Git log is shown by default (@stefanhaller) \r\n\r\n### More Breaking Changes 💥\r\n\r\n* When you press 'g' to bring up the git reset menu, the 'mixed' option is now the first and default, rather than 'soft'. This is because 'mixed' is the most commonly used option.\r\n* Push/pull/fetch loading statuses are now shown against the branch rather than in a popup. This allows you to e.g. fetch multiple branches in parallel and see the status for each branch.\r\n* The git log graph in the commits view is now always shown by default (previously it was only shown when the view was maximised). If you find this too noisy, you can change it back via `ctrl+L` -> 'Show git graph' -> 'when maximised'\r\n* Filtering (e.g. when pressing '/') is less fuzzy by default; it only matches substrings now. Multiple substrings can be matched by separating them with spaces. If you want to revert to the old behavior, set the following in your config:\r\n```yml\r\ngui:\r\n  filterMode: 'fuzzy'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n### All Enhancements 🔥\r\n* Add range

Time flies when you're having fun.\r\n\r\nI've written a post celebrating the anniversary [here](https://jesseduffield.com/Lazygit-5-Years-On).\r\n\r\nAs for this release, we've got some great features here. \r\n\r\n### Worktrees\r\n\r\nWe now have a worktrees view so you can easily create worktrees and switch to them and so on. I'm not a big worktrees user myself so please raise an issue if you can think of places to improve the UX.\r\n\r\n![worktree_create_from_branches-compressed](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/assets/8456633/3ef0b085-e9d0-42de-af58-16cbae581d34)\r\n\r\n### Rebase --onto\r\n\r\nRebasing onto a marked base commit is a very useful feature that we've been sorely lacking for a while\r\n(demo coming soon)\r\n\r\n### Auto-refresh on window focus\r\n\r\nAuto-refresh on window activation is a complete game-changer. No more having to manually press shift+R when you come back from your editor.\r\n\r\n### Nuking the worktree\r\n\r\nWe also have a fun enhancement in this release: showing an explosion animation when you nuke the working tree.\r\n\r\n![nuke-gif](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/assets/8456633/32b3f91c-fea3-474d-8997-1de2f5e4f5d4)\r\n\r\nYou'll also notice in the readme we've got some updated demo gifs to showoff Lazygit's features. More of those to come.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n### Features ✨\r\n* Add worktrees view by @jesseduffield (with help from @kadaan) in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2147\r\n* Rebase onto branch from a marked base commit by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2835\r\n* Auto-refresh on window activation by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2854\r\n### Enhancements 🔥\r\n* Speed up refresh by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2841\r\n* Add os.copyToClipboardCmd to allow for a custom command #1055 by @redstreet in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2784\r\n* Add bisect menu entry that lets you choose bisect terms by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2838\r\n* When bisecting, always mark the current commit as good/bad, not the selected by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2837\r\n* Visualize local branch heads in commits panel, 2nd approach by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2775\r\n* Allow force-tagging if tag exists by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2827\r\n* Save IgnoreWhitespaceInDiffView in state.yml by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2830\r\n* Show loader when rebasing by @KarlHeitmann in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2851\r\n* Internationalise logging of commands by @KarlHeitmann in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2852\r\n* Show visual explosion effect when nuking worktree by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2861\r\n### Fixes 🔧\r\n* Fix issue where using `null` to un-map a keybinding was ignored by @hatredholder in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2832\r\n* Show error when trying to open patch menu with an empty patch by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2829\r\n* Fix merge status for update-ref command by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2845\r\n* Stop worktrees view from stealing the window by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2863\r\n* Fix confirmation view sizing by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2879\r\n### Maintenance ⚙️\r\n* Standardise on using lo for slice functions by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2846\r\n* Remove redundant secureexec package by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2847\r\n* Add automated demo recordings by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2853\r\n* Remove file watcher code by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2865\r\n* Add more demos to the README by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2866\r\n* Move features to top of readme by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2867\r\n* Add more demos by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2874\r\n### Other Changes\r\n* Create demo output dir if it doesn't already exist by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2857\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @hatredholder made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2832\r\n* @redstreet made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2784\r\n* @kadaan made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2147\r\n* @KarlHeitmann made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2851\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/compare/v0.39.4...v0.40.0\r\n\r\n",

We're going to revisit the UX for this before considering re-introducing it. If you would like to re-enable the feature, set `gui.experimentalShowBranchHeads` to `true` in the lazygit config. As the name suggests, this is experimental and we may change this config in the future.\r\n \r\n * https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2582 Make branch head markers in compact view opt-in (@stefanhaller)\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/compare/v0.38.0...v0.38.1\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "# v0.38\r\n\r\n_Most recent patch: [v0.38.2](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases/tag/v0.38.2)_\r\n\r\nWe've got lots of goodies in this release. Some notable improvements are a revamped commit message panel (@seand52), much better interactive rebase behaviour (@stefanhaller), and much less error-prone custom patch behaviour (also @stefanhaller).\r\n\r\nAs you can see, @mark2185 and @Ryooooooga continue their reign as top contributors, but we are now also joined by @stefanhaller who is behind many of the big improvements in this release. I'd also like to give a special shoutout to @seand52 who's behind the revamped commit message panel. And thank you to all the other contributors who contributed towards this release: @AKARSHITJOSHI, @axieax, @AzraelSec, @humblepenguinn, @jbrains, @jenskutilek, @knutwalker, @pereBohigas, @scallaway, @shinhs0506, @ShrutiC-git, @TylerBarnes, and @yk-kd.\r\n\r\nAs always if you're interested in contributing to Lazygit, don't hesitate to pick an issue and have a Go (pardon the pun), and if you'd like to support me please consider [donating](https://github.com/sponsors/jesseduffield).\r\n\r\nOn a more boring note intended for current/future contributors, we've now fully migrated to a new integration test pattern which makes it much easier to test your changes and prevent regressions. We've also got a huge refactor PR (https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2519) that's about to go in right after this release goes out, so if you have a PR open that now has conflicts, reach out to me (@jesseduffield) and I can help resolve them.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* 'x' no longer opens the menu, you'll need to use '?' or remap the keybinding. We did this so that we could use 'x' for destructive actions like nuking the working tree, as some people accidentally double-tapped 'D' and ... nuked their working tree)\r\n* You can no longer use 'y' or 'n' to respond to a confirmation popup. Instead you'll need to use 'enter' or 'esc'. This is again just freeing up keybindings for more uses.\r\n* We've changed how you configure your editor settings because it was a bit of a mess previously. See [here](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Config.md#configuring-file-editing) for the new approach. You'll get deprecation warnings upon closing lazygit until adjusting your config, so that nobody gets mad when we remove support in a following release.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2390 Revamp commit message panel (we now have a separate summary and description panel where 'enter' adds newlines in the description panel) (@seand52)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2421 Allow creating tags on branches with the 'T' keybinding (@Ryooooooga)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2453 Allow rebasing to first commit (@stefanhaller)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2476 Add icons for Kotlin files (@pereBohigas)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2433 Lazy-load commits when viewed within a branch (@Ryooooooga)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2370 Allow interactively rebasing onto a branch (@AzraelSec)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2344 Allow customising panel border styling with `gui.border` (single/double/rounded/hidden) (@yk-kd)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2485 Allow rewording the HEAD commit while rebasing (@stefanhaller)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2552 Better support for stacked branches via the `rebase.updateRefs` git config (@stefanhaller)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2496 Omit custom commands from history when they start with a space (@mark2185)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2558 Allow resetting author during rebase (@stefanhaller)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2523 Improve editor config (@stefanhaller)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2418 Allow copying remote branch name to clipboard (@mark2185)\r\n\r\n## Fixes/Minor Improvements\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2471, https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2507 Improve custom patch conflict handling (This is a big deal!

    "body": "## Features\r\n\r\n* Nerd fonts now supported! (@Ryooooooga)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8456633/179950774-ff20e6bc-1b0a-493e-9db9-86dcf2dc71aa.png)\r\n\r\n* Scrollbars! (non-interactive but cool nonetheless)\r\n* Diff hunks can now be edited directly (via a subprocess) (@Ryooooooga)\r\n* You can open lazygit to the panel that you care about e.g. run `lazygit log` to open lazygit to the commits panel. (@HiromasaNojima)\r\n* Most menus now have their own keybindings for each menu item, which should speed things up for power users.\r\n* You can now easily set/unset the upstream of a branch (@mark2185)\r\n* You can now select to stash exclusively unstaged/staged files (@mark2185)\r\n* Improved update flow (@moha-gh)\r\n* Fixed issue where we duplicated line breaks when parsing a commit message Don't duplicate line breaks when retrieving commit message (@moha-gh)\r\n* Some hard-to-reverse actions now have confirmation popups given it's easy to accidentally press the wrong key.\r\n* 'Gone' branches are now marked as such\r\n* More commit attributes can be copied with the 'y' key (@mark2185)\r\n* Custom commit author colours can now be specified with regular names (e.g. 'red') instead of only hex codes. (@Ryooooooga)\r\n* Commit author can now be set to another author or reset to the current git user (thanks @JensPfeifle)\r\n* Auto-refresh of files can be disabled with the `git.autoRefresh` config option (@moha-gh)\r\n* We now (again) honour push.default config value. In general we want to err on the side of having git commands do the same thing that would happen if you ran them directly from the terminal.\r\n* Files can now be opened from the merge conflicts panel (thanks @Ryooooooga)\r\n* You can now configure to always show the unstaged and staged changes panels, regardless of whether the selected file has both unstaged and staged changes. This can be done via `gui.splitDiff: 'always'` (@HiromasaNojima)\r\n* Commit time format can now be customised via the `gui.timeFormat` config key (@Ryooooooga)\r\n* We now record the current directory on switch instead of exit (@davdroman)\r\n* We now support Bitbucket server PRs (thanks @TheBlob42)\r\n* Bottom line (containing some keybindings help) can now be hidden via `gui.showBottomLine: false` in your config.\r\n* You can now show the whole git graph in the commits panel by default via `git.log.showWholeGitGraph: true`\r\n* Some UI tweaks.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Various fixes to bugs relating to double-width characters (@Ryooooooga)\r\n* Typo fixes (@casswedson)\r\n* LOTS of other bug fixes (thanks to the glorious @Ryooooooga and @mark2185)\r\n\r\n## Translation updates:\r\nChinese translated updated (@Crystal-RainSlide)\r\nJapanese translation added (@Ryooooooga)\r\nKorean translation added (@Shin-JaeHeon)\r\n\r\nHUGE thankyou to all the contributors who've helped bring about this release. As you can see @mark2185 and @Ryooooooga are behind many of the the changes so a special thankyou to the both of you!\r\n\r\n## Maintenance stuff:\r\nWe've now on go1.18 meaning we can use generics. The lo package is our main generics helper package. I've also rolled my own, called 'generics', but I'll probably end up just committing to using lo only.\r\n\r\nIntegration tests in CI are now run in parallel, and windows builds are now properly cached, so CI runs much faster and you'll sooner know if you've broken a test.\r\n\r\n## Note from maintainer:\r\n\r\nI'm working on some tricky features like the ability to filter the contents of a list panel, some of which I've recorded on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFQFkdzh_Js&ab_channel=JesseDuffield). As part of that work I've had to make a detour to do some yak shaving and refactoring (which is happening in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2023)\r\n\r\nI've also made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNavnhzZHtk&ab_channel=JesseDuffield) showing how to add a basic feature to Lazygit for aspiring contributors. If you would like to see similar videos/docs covering other topics to make life easier for new/existing contributors, lemme know!\r\n\r\nAt some point I want to take time off work to go full-time on Lazygit (e.g. for a few months). If you have any ideas how I could raise money to do that, let me know! And of course for all those currently sponsoring, thankyou so much, it's a big motivator for me finding the time to work on this project.\r\n\r\nSome more rambling thoughts:\r\n* The integration test suite has some good coverage but the mechanism behind it (recording a Lazygit session and having the test replay that session) is hard to maintain. I want to switch to having integration tests be built by calling a bunch of commands in sequence, similar to Cypress if anybody's used that.\r\n* I was holding off this release for the sake of a better in-app release notes feature but that can wait for a future release.",

The refactor is about 90% done but the 10% might take some time and it's tricky to have to re-implement all PRs from contributors to the new branch. At any rate this refactor should make the code easier to work with compared to the previous god struct (the Gui struct) that was being used for everything. The new structure no doubt will have its own flaws that I'll need to work through over time. I've been using the refactor PR myself for a while and haven't run into any bugs, and I've added some more integration tests to capture more of the expected behaviour. Don't hesitate to raise an issue for any bug you find.",

It's a convenient way of testing a feature with a given pre-built example repo.\r\n* I've replaced the contributor code of conduct with a very stripped down version that basically says 'be nice'. The original was a little intense and didn't reflect the natural level of charity and positivity in the issues board. If people have an issue with that let me know.\r\n* I've added some extra sections to the contributing guide including:\r\n  - how the codebase (intentionally) diverges from some Go idioms\r\n  - i18n\r\n  - testing\r\n  - debugging\r\n\r\n\r\n## Note from maintainer:\r\n* Still working on this gui package refactor. I expect the health of the codebase to increase quite a bit with the change. I regret not trying to slice it up into smaller pieces but hopefully I'll have learnt my lesson next time.\r\n* We might need to rethink how integration tests are done. Right now it's a direct recording which can make the tests difficult to update.\r\n",

If it hasn't you'll need to run `go run scripts/cheatsheet/main.go generate`\r\n\r\n## Note from maintainer:\r\nThe codebase has grown quite a bit since its inception and it's in need of some refactoring to make future growth easier. I've wrapped up some refactoring to the internal `commands` package so that we've got better namespacing and separation of concerns, and I'll be shifting my gaze to the GUI package next. Once I'm happy with the structure of the code I'll start producing some documentation so that new contributors can easily get started on features and bug fixes. Many changes to the app are trivial to make but it can take a new contributor time to work out where everything lives in the code.\r\n",

    "body": "LAZYGIT NOW SHOWS A COMMIT GRAPH!\r\n\r\nNo idea why that took so long but there you go. Some new changes:\r\n1) the git graph now appears when you maximise the commits panel with the `+` key.\r\n2) you can scroll horizontally with shift+H and shift+L, in case that graph gets a bit out of control\r\n3) you can show the whole commit graph (i.e. `git log --all`) via the git log menu with `<c-l>` in the commits panel. In that menu you can also hide/show the graph\r\n4) we now randomly assign colors to authors so you can easily see at a glance who authored which commits. These same colors are used in the commit graph as well\r\n5) you can set custom author colours in the config e.g.\r\n```yml\r\ngui:\r\n  authorColors:\r\n      'Jesse Duffield': '#fa8072' # it's not pink, it's a _faded salmon_ color\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdmittedly the commits pane takes a while to load if you scroll past 300 commits so that will need to be fixed in an upcoming release.\r\n\r\nIf you have any concerns/suggestions about the changes in this release please raise an issue or start a discussion\r\n\r\nThanks to @Ryooooooga , @Liberatys , and @mjarkk for the help",

    "body": "## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\n* many more places where suggestions are shown as you type in a prompt. For example, when:\r\n  - searching for a file to check its history\r\n  - checking out a branch\r\n  - setting a remote branch to track\r\n  - entering a custom command\r\n* added support for diff3 merge conflict style (thanks @Ryooooooga )\r\n* files in the working tree can now be filtered by staged/unstaged with <c-b> (thanks @Liberatys )\r\n* gui language can now be set manually with gui.language config key (thanks @Dwarven )\r\n* cherry picked commit colour is now customisable (thanks @samburville )\r\n* you can now define multiple config files to merge into one another, allowing for light/dark theming without having to duplicate other configuration (thanks @mjarkk )\r\n* in the staging panel you can now copy the selected lines to the clipboard (thanks @Hrily )\r\n* jump-to-block keybindings (default 1-5) are now configurable (thanks @samburville )\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes:\r\n* fixed panic when resolving merge conflicts (thanks @Ryooooooga)\r\n* fixed issues opening files on windows (thanks @Ryooooooga)\r\n* fixed bug where deleting unmerged branches caused issues when not in english (thanks @Ryooooooga)\r\n* fixed crash when removing tracked files (thanks @Ryooooooga)\r\n* better support for different encoding schemes\r\n* patch files are now saved in temp directory to save space (thanks @Ryooooooga)\r\n* fixed various crashes caused by improper quotation in git commands (thanks @Ryooooooga)\r\n* fixed various issues with the commit message editor\r\n* fixed issue where the main panel scrolled back to the top whenever lazygit refreshed\r\n* fixed issue where pressing tab in a confirmation panel would spawn a random panel at the edge of the application\r\n* fixed issue where commits panel would be empty on older git versions (thanks @Ryooooooga)\r\n* As part of an initiative to let the git config drive of lazygit's behaviour, pull logic has been simplified so that now the git config's setting is honoured. Highly recommended: set `pull.rebase = interactive` and `rebase.autoSquash = true` so that you can see the commits yet to be rebased when midway through pulling. Note that this means the `git.pull.mode` lazygit config has been removed\r\n* --follow-tags has been removed from `git push`, so if you still want that you'll need to set it in your git config with `pull.followTags = true`\r\n\r\n### Other Changes:\r\n* file tree view is now shown by default. You can switch to flat view with the backtick key\r\n* if you hide the command log panel from within lazygit, it will stay hidden when you open lazygit again. This spares you from having to hide it manually in your lazygit config.\r\n* improved chinese translation (thanks @btwise and @black-desk )\r\n* updates to polish translation (thanks @HTD )\r\n* lots of new tests added for dealing with remotes (pushing, pulling, fetching, setting upstream, etc)\r\n* fixed some misspellings (thanks @codesoap )",

    "body": "# lazygit 0.28 Release notes\r\n\r\nThanks to everybody who filled out the survey at:\r\n\t- https://forms.gle/AdFEuLy2dikcmK4F7\r\n\r\nIt's still open so if you want to leave feedback about lazygit please click the link!\r\n\r\nOkay what's new in this release?\r\n\r\n## Command Log Panel\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8456633/115366163-6998ed00-a208-11eb-9f11-faee54dcaa9a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerned that you have no idea what git commands lazygit is running under the hood? Even I was starting to wonder myself. Well now there's a command log panel which tells you exactly what's going on. Paradoxically, this makes lazygit a valuable resource for learning how to use git on the command line.\r\n\r\nThe panel is shrunk to a single row when your terminal pane is small enough so that you have some more space. If there's more room it will be a little larger. You can maximise it by clicking it or pressing '@' and switching to it. You can also hide it for the current session through the menu that comes up when you hit '@'.\r\n\r\nIf you want to hide it permanently you can add the following to your config (which you can edit by pressing 'o' while the status panel is focused):\r\n\r\n```yml\r\ngui:\r\n  showCommandLog: false\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also change the default size of the panel (in its semi-enlarged form) like so:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\ngui:\r\n  commandLogSize: 10\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Random Tip\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8456633/115366461-b41a6980-a208-11eb-8c4e-a86ff146cbdd.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSome responses to the above survey mentioned features that would be cool to add... which already existed! So we're seeing how we go with a random tip that is shown in the command log panel when lazygit is opened, providing general tips for using lazygit so that the user can get a little more familiar with the app. If you find this annoying, you can disable it like so:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\ngui:\r\n  showRandomTip: false\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdmittedly if the random tip spans several lines and you only have a one-line-high command log, you're gonna need to scroll up. Not too sure how to get around that one.\r\n\r\n## Ask Question Button\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8456633/115366336-951bd780-a208-11eb-8b38-451b7505dfe1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're lost and want to ask a question, _any_ question, you can now click the 'Ask Question' button at the bottom right of the app. It will take you to the discussions page of the lazygit repo.\r\n\r\n\r\n## File sorting\r\n\r\nWe now bubble tracked files to the top when in flat file mode again. So first you'll see files with merge conflicts, then tracked files, then untracked files.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* when you open a panel for editing text, the cursor now appears at the end, not the start, of the text.\r\n* when using an east-asian character encoding, the rendering of frames is no longer broken\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "# lazygit 0.27.1-0.27.4 Release notes\r\n\r\nVersion 0.27 was quite ambitious so a few bugs were introduced. Lesson learnt,\r\nrelease features gradually! All the newly introduced bugs should now be fixed,\r\nexcept for https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/issues/1233 which looks to\r\nbe a limitation of the new rendering library, tcell.\r\n\r\nYou can also now open 'git mergetool' by pressing shift+M in the files panel or\r\nmerge panel.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, these releases contained minor bug fixes and improvements.\r\n\r\nlazygit 0.27 Release Notes\r\n\r\nHoly Moly, this is a big one.\r\n\r\nThere are two big changes here:\r\n1) Tree view for the files panel\r\n2) New rendering library\r\n\r\n## File tree view\r\n\r\nThis is off by default, but can be configured via the 'gui.showFileTree' config\r\nkey and toggled from within lazygit with the backtick key (the one below tilde).\r\n\r\nHitting enter on directories will toggle whether they are collapsed. Most\r\nkeybindings that apply to files also apply to directories e.g. if you hit space\r\non a directory, it will stage that whole directory.\r\n\r\nWhen not in tree-mode, the merge conflicts are now bubbled up to the top of the\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nThe tree view makes it much easier to deal with tonnes of files, because you can\r\neasily collapse folders you don't care about to focus on the important changes.\r\nIt also reduces the amount of horizontal space used meaning there is less chance\r\nof content being truncated by the frame of the panel.\r\n\r\n## New rendering library\r\n\r\nWe've switched from the termbox package to tcell, with the help of the contributors\r\nof the awesome-gocui repo. This has many benefits:\r\n- More support for various terminals\r\n- 24 bit colour support (you can now drop the -24-bit-color=never arg if you're using delta)\r\n- Support for more keybindings like... SHIFT-TAB! Which means you can now navigate\r\n  the side panels with tab and shift-tab. (Previously pressing shift+tab would\r\n  crash the program).\r\n- Better support for switching to subprocesses. Most of that benefit\r\n\r\nOther stuff:\r\n- No more flickering e.g. when staging a file or when contents are refreshed\r\n- You can now scroll the main panel with your mouse or pgup/pgdown. Before, doing\r\n  so would move the cursor which was weird\r\n- You can now insert a newline to the commit message panel via alt-enter. I've\r\n  changed the default keybinding from <tab> to <a-enter>. Let me know if that makes\r\n  you angry\r\n- When you scroll the main view, it will now stop just shy of scrolling too far\r\n- The gui no longer re-initialises when returning from a subprocess or switching\r\n  repos\r\n- By default, 'esc' no longer quits lazygit. Instead you'll need to use ctrl+c\r\n  or 'q'. We use escape for exiting various modes in lazygit (e.g. cherry-picking)\r\n  and it gets annoying when you accidentally hit esc one too many times and end\r\n  up quitting. It's still configurable though\r\n- Faster startup time\r\n- Custom commands now run in your shell so you have more freedom to get freaky with it\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- No more panicking when attemping to enter an unprintable key (thanks @fsmiamoto!)\r\n- Rewording the topmost commit no longer commits staged files as well\r\n- When returning from a submodule we retain the state of the parent repo so that\r\n  you land back where you were in the submodules tab\r\n- Fixed a bug in search where the cursor would get stuck if the result set shrunk\r\n- Commands now retry if .git/index.lock exists\r\n- Branches are no longer checked out when renamed\r\n- Fixed issue with merge conflicts on windows where the wrong command was invoked\r\n  causing a panic\r\n\r\nCode-stuff:\r\n- Lots of refactoring of the code itself. I'm considering a much bigger refactor\r\n  but need to investigate whether the approach is a good idea\r\n- Added a TUI for running/recording integration tests so that that whole workflow\r\n  is easier\r\n- Added over 40 new integration tests, so bugs will be caught sooner. As always,\r\n  if you catch a bug, please raise an issue for it!\r\n\r\n",

To enter a\r\n  submodule hit enter on it and then hit escape to return to the superproject\r\n\r\nBare repos:\r\n- Bare repos are now supported with the --git-dir and --work-tree args, so you\r\n  can use lazygit to manage your dotfiles!\r\n\r\nStaging panel navigation:\r\n- Ability to search with '/' and jump page by page with ',', '.', '<', '>' in\r\n  the staging and patch-building contexts\r\n\r\nMore clipboard stuff:\r\n- More text copying. Pressing `ctrl+o` on a commit to copy\r\n  its SHA, or a file to copy its name, etc.\r\n\r\nEasily view lazygit logs:\r\n- View lazygit logs with `lazygit --logs` (in another\r\n  terminal tab run `lazygit --debug` to write to logs)\r\n\r\nOther:\r\n- For the butterfingers of the world, you are now protected from accidentally\r\n  deleting the .gitignore file (thanks @kobutomo!)\r\n\r\n- Fewer panics\r\n\r\n- No more 'invalid merge' errors on startup\r\n\r\n- Smaller binary after ditching the Viper and i18n package. Beware! This means\r\n  configs are now case-sensitive so if your config stops working check the case\r\n  sensitivity of the keys against what you get from `lazygit --config`\r\n\r\n- Code refactor for better dev experience including more type safety\r\n\r\n- Integration tests have finally been added and there are many more to come.\r\n  These will assist in ensuring no regressions have been introduced in future\r\n  releases. Making an integration test is actually pretty fun you basically just\r\n  record yourself using lazygit and that's it. See the guide to integration tests at\r\n  https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Integration_Tests.md\r\n\r\n- Showing release notes from within lazygit, as you no doubt have realised. I'm\r\n  too lazy to include retrospective release notes but better late than never.",

This scopes the commits panel, reflog panel and stash panel. It's a pretty good replacement for `git log -p <path>` which I had been doing previously\r\n\r\n",

Currently only lightweight tags are supported, with support for annotated tags coming soon.\r\n\r\n## Remotes\r\nIn the same panel we also display remotes\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8456633/69333472-c9eecc80-0cac-11ea-81a0-1bb3eff956ed.png)\r\n\r\nhitting 'enter' on a remote will take you to the remote's branches\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8456633/69333501-d6732500-0cac-11ea-8eb1-b5d5f336dafa.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## File Watching\r\nAny files that show up in your `git status` will be watched for changes. This makes lazygit update faster whenever you change a file in your editor (however newly made files will still take a couple seconds to show up). For now I don't want to watch your whole repo in case you have a heap of files and it drains your CPU resources (but this may change in the future if it turns out not to be a big deal)\r\n",

    "body": "## Changelog\r\n\r\nGood Lord. There are two big new features in this release:\r\n\r\n###  Revamped Line-by-line Staging\r\nIf you hit 'enter' on a file in the files panel you will now be able to stage lines individually with 'space' AND reset them with 'd' AND switch over to do the same with the staged changed by pressing 'tab'. You can select a range of lines by pressing 'v' and moving your cursor down then pressing 'space' to stage the range of lines, and you can select the whole hunk by pressing 'a'.\r\n\r\n### Patch Madness\r\nI am yet to think of a better name, bear with me. This feature allows you to \r\n1) select snippets of code from old commits to discard e.g. `console.log` or `binding.pry` statements you accidentally added.\r\n2) move code between old commits\r\n3) pull code from a commit out into your index (for when you accidentally committed something but want to keep working on it)\r\n\r\nI'll write some proper documentation for it soon, but for now all you need to know is that if you hit 'space' on a file in a commit (accessed by pressing enter on the commit itself) it will add that file's patch to your 'custom patch' and if you hit 'enter' on the file it will allow you to take a line-by-line approach. Then hit ctrl+p to bring up the patch options menu and you'll be able to pick between:\r\n\r\n1) discarding the contents of the patch from the original commit\r\n2) pulling out the contents of the patch into your index\r\n3) moving the contents to another commit (if you've selected another commit in the commits panel)\r\n",

This is now possible! Press 'r' on a selected branch and you will rebase onto that branch. If conflicts arise and you want to skip/continue/abort, press 'm' to view the \r\nmerge/rebase options menu.\r\n\r\nIf you want to interactively rebase, there are lots of new commands for the commits panel. For example:\r\n- e: edit the commit\r\n- s: squash the commit\r\n- f: fixup the commit\r\n- p: pick the commit (while in a rebase state)\r\n- d: drop the commit\r\n- r: reword the commit subject line\r\n- R: reword the commit with you selected editor\r\n- J: move the commit up\r\n- K: move the commit down\r\n- A: amend your staged changes to the current commit\r\n\r\nYou can do these directly, or if you are already in a rebase state, you can set the edit/pick/squash/fixup/drop/reword values on the commits that remain in the 'todo' section, then hit 'm' and select continue to continue the rebase.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to @glvr182 for starting this feature off\r\n\r\n# CHERRY-PICKING:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8456633/53695288-91048400-3e0d-11e9-81d8-53280e776682.png)\r\n\r\nIf you press 'c' on a commit, it will be copied. Shift+C will copy a range of commits. If you then press 'v' on the commits panel in another branch, the copied commits will be cherry-picked across in the same order as they appeared before.\r\n\r\n# MOUSE-SUPPORT:\r\n\r\nThis isn't fully done yet so it's turned off by default, but if you turn it on in your config by setting gui.mouseEvents: true, you will be able to use your mouse to focus panels, scroll panels, and click on files to stage/unstage them. When this has a bit more testing I'll turn the option on by default.\r\n\r\nThis is a very large release so there is bound to be some bugs. Please create an issue if you come across any problems, or if you think a feature could be designed a little better. Happy coding!",

This is the first cut and in the future it will be easier to un-stage lines as well.\r\n* If git asks for a username/password, you can enter them from within the app. Thanks to @mjarkk!\r\n* You can fast-forward branches (e.g. master and develop) without checking them out.\r\n* Fixed bug where the recent repos menu was too tall. Thanks to @KOREAN139!\r\n* Tab spacing is now shown in the main panel.\r\n* Clearing the working tree is now faster.\r\n* You can now generate a cheatsheet for the app in your language. We will later automatically generate this with each release. Thanks to @dawidd6!\r\n\r\nIf you have contributed some code in this release but I've forgotten about you, please let me know!\r\nStay Lazy!",

Thanks @kristijanhusak For this feature!\r\n\r\nThe workflow for force deleting a branch is smoother: you just hit 'd' to delete the branch, and if it has unmerged changes you'll get prompted for a confirmation to force delete it. Thanks @rozuur!\r\n\r\n",
