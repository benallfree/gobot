Hello, this is a courtesy message to say that support for FerretDB has been added to the [Gobot project](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gobot) ðŸŽ¸

You can run the latest version of `ferretdb` anywhere npm/npx is available:

```bash
npx gobot ferretdb --help
```

The package is [https://npmjs.org/gobot-ferretdb](https://npmjs.org/gobot-ferretdb).

## What's next

- **Test & Feedback.** Please test and review as you are able. I have tagged things as alpha for now, but I will promote it to stable after a brief testing period and back-publish all 54 versions of FerretDB.
- **Update FerretDB installation docs.** Please consider adding Gobot to your official install instructions. If you would like me to send a PR updating the FerretDB installation docs to include instructions for installation via Gobot, I'm happy to do that.
- **Give Gobot a ðŸ’«.** Gobot is a big effort to solve binary dependencies for nodejs in a universal way. Please consider giving [the Gobot project](https://github.com/benallfree/gobot) a star if it resonates.
- **Keep going.** Keep doing what you do! Gobot will automatically pick up and publish your new releases.

Thanks for the great project and I hope this helps make FerretDB even more popular!
