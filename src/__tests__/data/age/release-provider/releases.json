It features small explicit keys, no config options, and UNIX-style composability. Learn more by reading the [README](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/blob/main/README.md), the [age(1) man page](https://filippo.io/age/age.1), the [Go API reference](https://pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/age), the [format specification](https://age-encryption.org/v1), or the [full release changelog](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0). Watch the repository or [follow @filippo@abyssdomain.expert](https://abyssdomain.expert/@filippo) to be notified of new releases.\r\n\r\n🛠️ FYI, age now has an extensive [test suite](https://c2sp.org/CCTV/age) which all age implementations are encouraged to adopt.\r\n\r\n## Plugin support\r\n\r\nThe age CLI now supports plugins, such as [age-plugin-yubikey](https://github.com/str4d/age-plugin-yubikey) by @str4d. To try it on macOS with Homebrew:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ brew upgrade age\r\n$ brew install age-plugin-yubikey\r\n$ age-plugin-yubikey # interactive setup\r\n$ age -r age1yubikey1qwt50d05nh5vutpdzmlg5wn80xq5negm4uj9ghv0snvdd3yysf5yw3rhl3t\r\n$ age -d -i age-yubikey-identity-388178f3.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlugins must be loaded explicitly by using their respective recipient or identity, and are not tied to a specific header stanza type. This means plugins can be used not only to support new recipient types such as PIV tokens (i.e. YubiKeys) or cloud KMS solutions, but also to produce passphrase-encrypted files that can be decrypted without plugins, to store age native private keys on secure elements, or even for agent functionality or to proxy decryption operations to remote machines.\r\n\r\nPlugins operate over a simple textual stdin/stdout protocol (https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/pull/5). Developers are encouraged to [reach out](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/discussions) with plugin ideas and announcements. Read more in [the relevant man page section](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/blob/main/doc/age.1.html#Plugins).\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n**If `-i` is used, passphrase-encrypted files are now rejected.** Previously, a passphrase-encrypted file was auto-detected and the identity file was ignored. This could lead to unexpected behavior, such as a script blocking for user interaction, based on potentially untrusted input files. Now, `age -d` must be invoked without `-i` arguments to decrypt passphrase-encrypted files. A helpful error is printed otherwise. This should not break any automated system as passphrase decryption was always interactive.\r\n\r\n**Empty final chunks are now rejected.** If a payload was a multiple of 64KiB long, there were two valid encryptions for it: with a \"full\" last chunk encrypting 64KiB, or with an additional \"empty\" chunk encrypting 0 bytes. age, rage, and all other known implementations only ever produced the former. (Note that [age will forever decrypt files it generated](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/blob/main/doc/age.1.html#BACKWARDS-COMPATIBILITY).) The latter is now rejected. The specification has been updated (https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/pull/13) and test cases are included in the test suite.\r\n\r\n## Minor changes\r\n\r\nPKCS#8-encoded Ed25519 private keys (such as 1Password exports) are now supported as SSH identities.\r\n\r\nIf an armored file is pasted into the terminal, age will now attempt to wait until the end of the file before prompting for a password.\r\n\r\nSome invalid files are now correctly rejected, in particular encrypted files with trailing data. (Yay for the test suite!)\r\n\r\nIf `/dev/tty` is present but can't be opened, age will now fallback to trying to treat stdin as a terminal as if `/dev/tty` wasn't present. (Thanks @brandsimon!)\r\n\r\nInput prompts now go to the terminal, even if standard error is redirected.\r\n\r\nValues of the new `armor.Error` type are now returned wrapped in decryption errors when appropriate.\r\n\r\nWindows binary releases are now signed. (Thanks @technion!)\r\n\r\nDocumentation and error messages were improved.\r\n",

It features small explicit keys, no config options, and UNIX-style composability. Learn more by reading the [README](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/blob/main/README.md), the [age(1) man page](https://filippo.io/age/age.1), the [Go API reference](https://pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/age), the [format specification](https://age-encryption.org/v1), or the [full release changelog](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0-rc.1). Watch the repository or [follow @FiloSottile on Twitter](https://twitter.com/FiloSottile) to be notified of new releases.\r\n\r\n**v1.1.0-rc.1** is the first release candidate of v1.1.0. Users are encourage to test the new release and especially the new features listed below. Issue or UX reports in advance of the final release are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n📃 In case you missed it: a new, more polished version of [the age format specification](https://age-encryption.org/v1) has been published.\r\n\r\n## Plugin support\r\n\r\nThe age CLI now supports plugins, such as [age-plugin-yubikey](https://github.com/str4d/age-plugin-yubikey) by @str4d. To test it on macOS with Homebrew:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ brew install --HEAD age\r\n$ brew install age-plugin-yubikey\r\n$ age-plugin-yubikey # interactive setup\r\n$ age -r age1yubikey1qwt50d05nh5vutpdzmlg5wn80xq5negm4uj9ghv0snvdd3yysf5yw3rhl3t\r\n$ age -d -i age-yubikey-identity-388178f3.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlugins must be loaded explicitly by using their respective recipient or identity, and are not tied to a specific header stanza type. This means plugins can be used not only to support new recipient types such as PIV tokens (i.e. YubiKeys) or cloud KMS solutions, but also to produce passphrase-encrypted files that can be decrypted without plugins, to store age native private keys on secure elements, or even for agent functionality or to proxy decryption operations to remote machines.\r\n\r\nPlugins operate over a simple textual stdin/stdout protocol (https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/pull/5). Developers are encouraged to [reach out](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/discussions) with plugin ideas and announcements. Read more in [the relevant man page section](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/blob/main/doc/age.1.html#Plugins).\r\n\r\n## CLI breaking changes\r\n\r\n**If `-i` is used, passphrase-encrypted files are now rejected.** Previously, a passphrase-encrypted file was auto-detected and the identity file was ignored. This could lead to unexpected behavior, such as a script blocking for user interaction, based on potentially untrusted input files. Now, `age -d` must be invoked without `-i` arguments to decrypt passphrase-encrypted files. A helpful error is printed otherwise. This should not break any automated system as passphrase decryption was always interactive.\r\n\r\n**Empty final chunks are now rejected.** If a payload was a multiple of 64KiB long, there were two valid encryptions for it: with a \"full\" last chunk encrypting 64KiB, or with an additional \"empty\" chunk encrypting 0 bytes. age, rage, and all other known implementations only ever produced the former. (Note that [age will forever decrypt files it generated](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/blob/main/doc/age.1.html#BACKWARDS-COMPATIBILITY).) The latter is now rejected. The specification is being updated (https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/pull/13) and test cases will be provided.\r\n\r\n## Minor changes\r\n\r\nIf `/dev/tty` is present but can't be opened, age will now fallback to trying to treat stdin as a terminal as if `/dev/tty` wasn't present.\r\n\r\nWindows binary releases are now signed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation and error messages were improved.\r\n",

When it's explicitly specified, it's now possible to use `-i`/`--identity` to encrypt symmetrically to an identity file.\r\n* The new `age-keygen` `-y` mode converts an identity file into the corresponding recipients."

If third-party code implemented custom recipients or identities, they will need to update.\r\n\r\nThe `IdentityMatcher` interface was also removed, a positive side-effect of this change.\r\n\r\nThe header format was also changed to expect a short line at the end of every stanza, which allows the format to be used in a streaming protocol. No encrypted files produced by cmd/age are affected. A small number of encrypted files produced by rage are affected, and won't decrypt with newer versions of age. They still decrypt with any version of rage.\r\n\r\nFinally, an `NoIdentityMatchError` type was added, to detect the specific `Decrypt` error condition.\r\n\r\nThis is hopefully the first and last breaking change before v1.0.0 is released."
